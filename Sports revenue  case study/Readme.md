Optimizing sports sales revenue
The sports revenue analysis project is aimed at improving the revenue of an online sports clothing company by analyzing product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic. The dataset used in this project contains five tables, with product_id being the primary key for all of them.

The data is explored and cleaned, with missing values in the description column being filled using the forward-fill method, and the missing values are manually filled in. Categories are created by defining keywords for footwear products and gender. A new column named "type" is created, with "footwear" or "clothing" values based on whether the product description contains footwear keywords or not.

SQL queries are used to obtain information on revenue by price category, revenue by brand and product type, and monthly reviews. The analysis shows that Nike's most sold products are within budget, and Adidas' expensive category has the highest revenue. Reviews are highest in the first quarter of the calendar year, and the majority of Adidas products are footwear, while Nike maintains sales in both clothing and footwear.

These findings could guide the marketing and sales teams in developing strategies for improving revenue by targeting specific price categories and product types. The visualizations created using this data could help in making decisions on which products to market and which products to prioritize.
