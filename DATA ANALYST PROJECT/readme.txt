The project aimed to analyze the sales strategies of a pens and printers company, using data from their product sales. The data contained 15000 rows and 8 columns and undergone  thorough cleaning, validation, and exploration.

The to handle data inconsistencey sales_method was converted to lowercase, and "em + call" was replaced with "email + call." The missing values in the revenue column were filled with the average revenue value. The years_as_customer column was cleaned by replacing two values greater than 39 with the mode value, because the company was invented in 1984.

The analysis revealed that email was the most popular sales method, followed by calls, with the combination of both being used by around 2500 customers. The revenue data was right-skewed, with a few high revenue values driving the overall distribution to the right. The majority of purchases were made at around $100 and $50.

Furthermore, the analysis suggested that the email sales method generated the most revenue, followed by email + call, and finally calls generating the least revenue. Customers using email + call tended to purchase in a wide price range, whereas email sales methods had the most purchases around $100, and calls had the least revenue range.

The insights gained from the analysis can be used to identify and prioritize effective sales methods and inform decision-making in future sales strategies for the company.
