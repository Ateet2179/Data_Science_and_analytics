Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
The project aims to predict the likelihood of loan approval using data on past loan applicants and their repayment behavior. The loan approval models can help lending institutions make more informed decisions about whether to approve or reject a loan application.

The project includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning: This step involves checking for categorical inconsistency, missing values, and treating them to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is visualized using different graphs to understand the relationship between variables and their impact on the loan approval status.
Feature Engineering: This step involves creating new features or modifying existing features in a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.
Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical form that can be used by machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of their predictions.
Model Building: The random forest classifier algorithm is used to predict loan approval status based on various features.
The project uses Python programming language and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn for data analysis and modeling.

The loan approval prediction model developed in this project can help lending institutions automate some of the decision-making processes and minimize their risk while approving loans.
