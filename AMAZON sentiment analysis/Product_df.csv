 Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager  and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop  as cool as possible.I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner. I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity.  For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.HP factory setting for this  laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card  as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller  or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease  the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again.  So I  used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop  temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C  and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling  at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500mAlso recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience.  I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for  xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.edit2:Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts  that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick.",Careful Buyer,2022-05-21,Overall Good Laptop for both medium-high graphic quality gaming and work/anything else,1385,Positive,HP,AMD,cheap,2022,2022-05

This is currently the best performance laptop you can buy in 50k-85k segment. And that's a huge claim, I know, but the Indian laptop market is that screwed at the moment. There are just no fair offerings in that segment and that segment is supposed to be multiple segments (like 50-60k, 60-70k, 70-80k and so on). Of course I'm leaving out RTX3050 laptops but I don't think they're priced well for what they're offering. The only other laptops that make sense would be 3050Ti ones due to their higher performance and even then, their pricetags are not proportional to the increase in performance when compared to this RX5500M laptop. You pay way more than the performance bump you get.Also, please remember to uninstall bloatware and stick to OEM graphics drivers instead of installing Radeon graphics drivers (because every laptop is different and parent companies know better about what drivers would serve their laptops better- speaking from experience with this very laptop).The Victus has a lot of things going for it. Remember, I bought this was like 48k in a sale so the features it has at that price point are a no-brainer.Pros:- Tiny bezel around the screen makes it feel so slick and modern- Screen size is plenty big and the screen quality is quite pleasant to look at- Backlit keyboard (white light only but that's not something I consider a con since I don't like RGB anyways)- Numpad included in the keyboard- Awesome thermals. It plays games like CSGO and Mudrunner on max settings without having to ramp up the fans so the experience is quiet and pleasant. Although, playing more demanding games like Snowrunner do tend to make it run hot so the fans spool up to higher RPMs (in which case you can just use noise-cancelling headphones to offset that issue).- Best in class CPU and graphics card. I added in another 8GB RAM stick and this thing is now unstoppable!-Soild build quality. I was attacked by a dog so hard that I got knocked back while this laptop was in my bag behind my back and when I fell, the bag was crushed under my weight. Not a scratch.- Minimalist design is very much appreciated. I hate loud, flashy, obnoxious designs from other brands screaming, ""LOOK AT MEEE!!!1!1!!"" so this subtle, subdued but still upmarket design is great for me.- People complain about this laptop's screen wobbling issue, especially while under a running fan. Sure, it's a thin screen so it's bound to happen but honestly, I don't see it. Yeah, it does wobble if you slap the screen gently but that's rare and also, why would you? I just leave the screen alone and do my thing. Haven't had a problem yet.Cons:- It's very heavy. At 2.5 kg, this thing is a behemoth. But I guess, you can't have everything. I'm okay with this being the only con to that many features at this price point.- Can't think of any other cons. In fact, I haven't had any other issues with it during the last 5 months of my ownership at all whatsoever so... that's great!Honestly, this is a great value for money laptop and I recently recommend it and got at least 3 other people to buy it. Not one of them has had an issue either. This laptop was one of the best strategies adopted by HP of late. I look forward to many years of worry-free gaming and 3D animation with this thing.",Dhruv Srivastava,2023-01-22,Budget king - period,1385,Positive,HP,AMD,cheap,2023,2023-01

The RGB Backlit keyboard looks very eye-catching especially when the lights are turned off. Even after applying keyboard guard, the keys are visible clearly.3. Anti- glare screen is perfect. This is important because otherwise you would see your face while working on it which could be irritating/disturbing.4. The 144Hz refresh rate makes the display smooth. You can also set it to 60Hz to save battery.5. AMD Ryzen 5 4600H is a powerful processor. For normal use, it is more than enough.

Battery life is poor, which may leave you searching for sockets wherever you go. You would always have to worry about the battery when you carry laptop outside the room. The 48 Wh battery does not last long. At this range, other laptops have comparatively much better battery life.2. Speaker is not so good. I have enjoyed listening to music on other laptops, but this laptop won't give you that 'feel' of a good speaker. But since it is gaming laptop, you can compromise on this part.3. MS Office is not of life time warranty. This is not good if want to work on PPTs or documents. But you can always download other apps like WPS Office for free.4.

 Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager  and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop  as cool as possible.I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner. I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity.  For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.HP factory setting for this  laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card  as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller  or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease  the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again.  So I  used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop  temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C  and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling  at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500mAlso recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience.  I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for  xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.edit2:Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts  that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick.",Careful Buyer,2022-05-21,Overall Good Laptop for both medium-high graphic quality gaming and work/anything else,1385,Positive,HP,AMD,cheap,2022,2022-05

This is currently the best performance laptop you can buy in 50k-85k segment. And that's a huge claim, I know, but the Indian laptop market is that screwed at the moment. There are just no fair offerings in that segment and that segment is supposed to be multiple segments (like 50-60k, 60-70k, 70-80k and so on). Of course I'm leaving out RTX3050 laptops but I don't think they're priced well for what they're offering. The only other laptops that make sense would be 3050Ti ones due to their higher performance and even then, their pricetags are not proportional to the increase in performance when compared to this RX5500M laptop. You pay way more than the performance bump you get.Also, please remember to uninstall bloatware and stick to OEM graphics drivers instead of installing Radeon graphics drivers (because every laptop is different and parent companies know better about what drivers would serve their laptops better- speaking from experience with this very laptop).The Victus has a lot of things going for it. Remember, I bought this was like 48k in a sale so the features it has at that price point are a no-brainer.Pros:- Tiny bezel around the screen makes it feel so slick and modern- Screen size is plenty big and the screen quality is quite pleasant to look at- Backlit keyboard (white light only but that's not something I consider a con since I don't like RGB anyways)- Numpad included in the keyboard- Awesome thermals. It plays games like CSGO and Mudrunner on max settings without having to ramp up the fans so the experience is quiet and pleasant. Although, playing more demanding games like Snowrunner do tend to make it run hot so the fans spool up to higher RPMs (in which case you can just use noise-cancelling headphones to offset that issue).- Best in class CPU and graphics card. I added in another 8GB RAM stick and this thing is now unstoppable!-Soild build quality. I was attacked by a dog so hard that I got knocked back while this laptop was in my bag behind my back and when I fell, the bag was crushed under my weight. Not a scratch.- Minimalist design is very much appreciated. I hate loud, flashy, obnoxious designs from other brands screaming, ""LOOK AT MEEE!!!1!1!!"" so this subtle, subdued but still upmarket design is great for me.- People complain about this laptop's screen wobbling issue, especially while under a running fan. Sure, it's a thin screen so it's bound to happen but honestly, I don't see it. Yeah, it does wobble if you slap the screen gently but that's rare and also, why would you? I just leave the screen alone and do my thing. Haven't had a problem yet.Cons:- It's very heavy. At 2.5 kg, this thing is a behemoth. But I guess, you can't have everything. I'm okay with this being the only con to that many features at this price point.- Can't think of any other cons. In fact, I haven't had any other issues with it during the last 5 months of my ownership at all whatsoever so... that's great!Honestly, this is a great value for money laptop and I recently recommend it and got at least 3 other people to buy it. Not one of them has had an issue either. This laptop was one of the best strategies adopted by HP of late.

This review is based on usage of almost 20 days. That's more than enough time to cover all the testing that is needed to check whether the product is up to mark or not.I got the WQHD + 1TB SSD model although in the product description it was mentioned as FHD only.Pros:The QHD screen is really great specially while gaming and watching HD videos. Specially if you use it at its full capacity.The Processor/GPU. Lets say no more. It does exactly what it should. The boot time is around 3s so its fast.The keyboard is really good. It feels great to type with the keyboard.All high end games run smoothly without any issues. I tried GTA5 highest settings, PES 19 highest settings, Far Cry 5 highest settings, and it handles them quite great. 130W GPU is a beast in this range.Most people complain about fan noise but my unit runs quite during normal work. And it stays relatively cool.Cons:Battery backup is decent for a gaming laptop. I havent drained it 100% to check the total time but It would last around 4 hrs if you use it efficiently. I usually run it at 60hz refresh rate while using it on power. - Additionally if you limit it to 1080p instead of 1440p battery backup will improve.While playing games at the highest settings in Performance mode, the CPU temps goes above 95 degrees. While playing PES it got to 100 degrees. So I usually play those games in balanced mode with the back raised to allow airflow. Temps stay around 85 degrees.The trackpad sometimes becomes irresponsive. And apparently it is an issue that exists for all legion models. So better to use a mouse.Screen brightness can be an issue for people using it outdoors.1TB can be a problem for people who plays a lot of heavy games like GTA 5. 4-5 such games will take up almost 40% of your storage.Portability is a issue. I hardly take it outside. The power brick is huge lol.Opinion:It definitely lives up to its name specially given the sale pricesIf you are a casual gamer who likes gaming a lot, go for it blindly.If you are looking for mid range laptop that offers great performance for any task, go for it.If you are a student/employee who likes to code/program on the go, you might want to look at the G15/G14 as those are better for carrying around.Before buying this I was in a dilemma whether to buy it or not, or whether to buy this or the Zephyrus G15. Luckily my choice was made easier by the price drop as the g15 2021 is still price around 1.35 l. So if your budget is higher go for 2022 models or the Pro version or g15/g14. But at this range the difference is not that big apart from the form factor ofcourse.",Rituraj,2022-10-04,Best in business,220,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,expensive,2022,2022-10

I also ordered a gen4 ssd by WD in order to run linux. My main purpose wasn't gaming. Bought this solely for development works.I added secondary ssd. Opening the back shell wasn't that hard. One thing to notice is that the screw of ssd is very tight. So if your try to spin it without applying down force will endup in stripped screws. So keep that in mind. I installed Fedora 36. Faced some issues with Nvidia drivers. I would suggest to follow (https://asus-linux.org/wiki/fedora-guide/) if you are planning to install Fedora.I wanted to just try some games on this machine. So I tried pubg & hotpursuit. played PUBG in medium settings. When the heat rises, we can feel a framedrop. Avg temp was 89°C while playing games. When I tried in an AC enviorment, things where smooth. So I would suggest to invest in a cooling pad if you are into gaming.Apart from that, If you have oily hands, the laptop get dirty easily. The audio quality is fine. Anyway I was using headset.

LPDDR5 RAM. Great on paper. Doesn't display the potential because of throttling.2. Good to have thunderbolt 4. Future proof. Have connected camera, microphone, keyboard, mouse, monitor and soundbar. all works at once through a single type c port hub. Loving it. A great upgrade from my non thunderbolt laptop.3. Type c charging is great. If I forget my laptop charger at home, I can charge it with my 65w mobile warp charger. Handy.4. Wifi 6e. Future proof. Works great with my 5ghz router. Desperate to upgrade the router to have a taste of it. For future.5. Very light. Bought a hp wings backpack specially for this laptop which is just 150g. So 1199+150. 1350g approx. I leave my charger at home. The battery lasts the whole day with a weight of just 1350g. Majja ni life.Cons1. Gets hot while doing nothing. You can feel the heat on the keyboard.2. Charger is too heavy for a light weight laptop.3. Wrong information. No 6 month office 365 included. It asks for purchase. Customer care, no help yet.4. Screen is not HDR. I didn't check before purchasing, considering it as an obvious feature for the price.5. Lots of bloatware, i.e. Spotify and others6. Camera is said as 1080p. My USB 1080p external camera is way better than the inbuilt one. Don't know why so much difference. bad camera.7. Speeds up for the benchmark testing, starts heating and slows down (throttle) in less than 10 seconds. Cannot use i7 processor to its full potential because of throttling. Should have better cooling system.8. Keyboard, useless. As I gear up for touch typing screen starts shaking.9. Touchpad. Too big.

Tested with the new plague and rtx it was looking amazing running smooth ..got some crashed in high dense areas and had to lower rtx settings.Competitive Games will ran pretty good more than refresh rate of the screen with the good CPU GPU pair and fats ram . So no hiccups there.Ports:Bonus point for a thunderbolt c port..with fast 135watt charging .

Its smooth & fast (you might face few windows 11 bugs here & there but, it's not the laptop's fault.)‣Tested 'Shadow of the Tomb Raider' & 'Persona 5 Royal' at high graphic settings. No stutters, smooth performance and consistent frame rate. [IMO as far as gaming goes 1080p/1440p @60FPS for the next 7 years guaranteed]‣Copied 250GB in under 10 minutes from my Samsung T5 SSD [Didn't time it exactly]. Copy speed was about 450-460 MB/s.‣Only Wifi 6 (No 6e/7) which is fine by me. My steam/epic games store average download speed was around 8-10MP/s. [lowest 5MB/s, highest 11MB/s @ JioFibreNet]. Streamed 1440p Youtube videos with no problems/buffering.THE MEH:‣Build quality is OK [nothing great about it at this price point], the screen wobbles sometimes and especially when is under a fan.‣Keyboard is fine, nothing really to rave about & then there's RGB but never really cared about it.‣Hi-Res audio is supported so, if you have Hi-Res IEM/Headphones then use them. Listened to 16/24bit FLAC audio songs using my FiiO Hi-Res IEM with no problems.‣With peak brightness and 165hz display mode and performance settings the battery can it 4hrs at best. Can be extended to 7hrs with proper device optimizations (switching to 60Hz, power saving performance profile etc)‣Thermals are fine as of now. This is a compact laptop and is good for 2-4Hr session of gaming (highly depends on the game/ graphical settings used) for longevity of the hardware. Definitely could've had better cooling systems in place.THE UGLY:‣Speakers are bad period [low volume levels & lacks clarity].‣Lacks proper system monitoring/Diagnostics/Gaming software support from MSI. Dragon center MSI center pro are currently having compatibility issues. [hope this gets fixed soon as this is relatively new model in the market]. All the other competitors are doing good to great in this aspect.‣Display color calibration is off. Colors looks warmer. [I hope that this can be fixed by properly tweaking the settings, again requires software support from MSI]‣ LED backlight screen bleed issue that causes color inaccuracyNOTE: This laptop uses an industry grade 15/16A power supply cord instead of domestic 5A/6A power supply cord. You need to buy an additional 16A to 6A power supply converter socket.This is my review of this laptop from the experience of the past 2-4 days.

The QHD display with a 165Hz refresh rate, combined with the powerful hardware, can easily handle most of the AAA games with 100+ fps.Despite being a gaming laptop, it offers decent battery life when using battery saver mode and the super battery feature in MSI Center. I was able to get around 5-6 hours of screen time while browsing and streaming online content, which is impressive for a device of this caliber. Booting the laptop takes only 3-5 seconds, thanks to the speedy NVMe M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD.The display is excellent with bright colors, and it can handle 4K HDR videos effortlessly. With a refresh rate of 165Hz, browsing feels incredibly smooth. The speakers are clear and loud, and the backlit keyboard with three brightness levels adds to the overall experience.However, the build quality is not exceptional, but it is acceptable for the price range. Additionally, the webcam resolution is limited to 720p, which may not be sufficient for some users. One significant drawback is that the laptop tends to get warm during extended gaming sessions, and the heat is noticeable through the keyboard. However, turning on the dual fan mode and adding a cooling pad can help dissipate the heat quickly.It is worth noting that this gaming laptop is an excellent value for money option as it is one of the only devices with an RTX 3070 graphics card available under 1.25L. This powerful machine can easily handle any game for the next five years without compromising the performance.To use this laptop optimally, you will require a 16Amps socket, and adding a cooling pad is recommended to keep it cool during extended gaming sessions.

Cpu usage was around 50% and even cpu was drawing less power. I Think its because of software as to control thermals but even in cool environment (23°C)  I faced this issue.Due to less cpu usage and low clock speed, i was getting low benchmark.So, I concluded that may be 8gb ram is becoming bottleneck for my laptop.Then, Today on 1 oct , 2022, I upgraded my laptop ram to 16 gb ( G skill 3200mhz ddr4 8gb ram) and now i am facing this problem more.CPU Usage and Cpu power draw reduced more to only 13 watts during gaming ( Valorant ) and Fps count become ( 98 average).During gaming for 30 min, Tdp was set to 13 watts and not increasing a bit and my cpu temperature was locked at 61°C.After All this,My Conclusion - I think Asus Laptop bios have underclocked Cpu to control the thermals and there is no way to change it normally.Edit - After Many Days and Testing, I saw that this low cpu usage problem only happens sometimes when i plug in charger and when i unplug and plug the charger again in laptop, this low cpu usage issue solves automatically.",Vipul saini,2022-10-01,"LOW CPU USAGE, LOW CPU POWER DRAW ISSUE",111,Positive,ASUS,Nvidia,average,2022,2022-10

CPU {45Watt}+GPU{50Watt} which makes use of overall usage of 120  watts(rough estimation) including motherboard other components like speakers, display, etc. 15watt which is left can used to squeeze for extra performance of CPU  and  GPU (most Manufactures restricts chargers to 90Watt or 120 watt)*Lenovo vantage provides conservative mode which increases battery lifespan. most laptops OEM don't provide this feature.Cons:*The laptop doesn't have an option to set its refresh rate to 60Hz in settings by default it runs at 120HZ which can be an issue with battery drain as it has low capacity battery. I think it will be fixed with BIOS Update in future.*They could have done better with Battery instead of 45WHr.*Could have Given an extra usb port (as 2 usb port restricts ur workspace to limited options)*From gaming point of view they could have given mux switch which boosts fps (iGPU bottlenecks DGPU) .*Sweaty-wet hands can make laptop dirty with marks, its with build quality.

At that rate, the RTX 3050 is superior in every way, and you can leverage RT and DLSS.Now coming to the packaging, it included a 135W charging brick (which was surprisingly compact) and the laptop itself. Nothing else, no case or accessories, but that is to be expected from a budget laptop.Build Quality: The Shadow Black model is made of premium feeling plastic. The hinge seems to be extremely stable, but it is almost impossible to open the lid with one hand, which in my opinion isn't a big deal. Overall, a good package for the price. This wouldn't feel out of place in a professional setting unlike other gaming laptops.Screen: Yes, its only 250 nits and covers only 45% of NTSC, but I did not notice it personally. The brightness at 100% was sufficient for use during the day(indoors), and the screen was usable up to 20% brightness. Colors are vibrant and media consumption is a breeze on this screen.Battery Life: This is one of the few weak points of this laptop, With a measly 46Wh battery, I did not expect it to perform as good as say, the Asus Zephyrus series, but on a whole, battery life was quite disappointing to say the least, but typical for a gaming machine. It lasted for around 5 hours at 50% brightness and with Bluetooth and the backlight switched off, all while performing day to day tasks such as word processing, coding on Python, and watching YouTube. DO NOT game on battery power, as that will severely damage the cells.Performance: The 5600H is an excellent CPU for the money, and with SMT it is able to breeze through most of my requirements, but the same cannot be said of the GTX 1650. Although it is able to reach the refresh rate of the monitor on most eSports titles, it struggles to play through more demanding AAA games such as Cyberpunk 2077, where i was only getting 30fps on Medium settings. Meanwhile, I got 45fps at Medium settings in Control, and 120fps in Crysis. Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Terraria, Tomb Raider(2013), were all able to max out the refresh rate of the screen at their highest settings. I would strongly advise to upgrade the memory to a dual channel configuration as that would significantly improve the performance. Regarding thermals, the CPU did get quite hot while gaming(90C), but the heat was swiftly dissipated by the excellent cooling system. The GPU never throttled and always stayed under 75C.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their tactile keyboards, and this one is no exception. Has great travel distance and keystrokes feel snappy. The backlight comes in 2 levels, but I did not notice any difference in brightness between them (perhaps a defect). The touchpad was serviceable for daily tasks, but not for gaming.Verdict: On a whole, the new Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3 is an attractive options for gamers on a budget, with a sleek and professional design, great thermals and acceptable performance for the price. The keyboard is a stand-out in this price range, while the battery life is disappointing and below average in this class of laptops.",Harish,2022-01-21,Decent budget gaming machine with an elegant design.,366,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,cheap,2022,2022-01

There are many flaws hidden beneath the translucent chasis. Lets begin:Display - Display is the part we most interact in a Laptop. We constantly watch the screen and paying upwards of 1 lakh for an FHD 144HZ panel with poor color calibration. This means what you see is ain't the good thing.🫣Processor - The brain 🧠 of the computer. Here also we get a 12th gen Intel core i5 processor that performs good but does not justify the price.Graphics card - Here is the trick. On paper it has RTX 4050 with 6GB GDDR6 memory but the wattage is 45W with Dynamic boost. Ideally it shall run lower say strt from as low as 15W !🙁! It has MAX-Q version of NVIDIA graphics. The performance will be lower than any rtx 3060 and may be an 85W 3050TI surpass this where video memory is not the bottleneck as it has 4GB of VRAM. And 3060 laptops start from 80-85k amd 3050ti can be had with 75k.Keyboard and mouse - Keyboard has good travel bit the keys lack the feel of a good mechanical. But it descent enough for the price.What isn't descent is the track pad. It could have bigger and has a very wobbly feel.Design - Amazing design. They have truly justified the name and it looks quite funky.It is comparatively light at just 1.98 Kg !!Battery - good enough to last 4 hours on normal useVerdict - BUY this only if you need rtx 4050 dearly or the design and weight is a primary need for a gaming laptop. In every other scenario there are better laptops available for lesser price.,Devi Prasad Panda,2023-03-05,Read Terms and conditions carefully,4,Positive,MSI,Nvidia,expensive,2023,2023-03

CPU {45Watt}+GPU{50Watt} which makes use of overall usage of 120  watts(rough estimation) including motherboard other components like speakers, display, etc. 15watt which is left can used to squeeze for extra performance of CPU  and  GPU (most Manufactures restricts chargers to 90Watt or 120 watt)*Lenovo vantage provides conservative mode which increases battery lifespan. most laptops OEM don't provide this feature.Cons:*The laptop doesn't have an option to set its refresh rate to 60Hz in settings by default it runs at 120HZ which can be an issue with battery drain as it has low capacity battery. I think it will be fixed with BIOS Update in future.*They could have done better with Battery instead of 45WHr.*Could have Given an extra usb port (as 2 usb port restricts ur workspace to limited options)*From gaming point of view they could have given mux switch which boosts fps (iGPU bottlenecks DGPU) .*Sweaty-wet hands can make laptop dirty with marks, its with build quality.

At that rate, the RTX 3050 is superior in every way, and you can leverage RT and DLSS.Now coming to the packaging, it included a 135W charging brick (which was surprisingly compact) and the laptop itself. Nothing else, no case or accessories, but that is to be expected from a budget laptop.Build Quality: The Shadow Black model is made of premium feeling plastic. The hinge seems to be extremely stable, but it is almost impossible to open the lid with one hand, which in my opinion isn't a big deal. Overall, a good package for the price. This wouldn't feel out of place in a professional setting unlike other gaming laptops.Screen: Yes, its only 250 nits and covers only 45% of NTSC, but I did not notice it personally. The brightness at 100% was sufficient for use during the day(indoors), and the screen was usable up to 20% brightness. Colors are vibrant and media consumption is a breeze on this screen.Battery Life: This is one of the few weak points of this laptop, With a measly 46Wh battery, I did not expect it to perform as good as say, the Asus Zephyrus series, but on a whole, battery life was quite disappointing to say the least, but typical for a gaming machine. It lasted for around 5 hours at 50% brightness and with Bluetooth and the backlight switched off, all while performing day to day tasks such as word processing, coding on Python, and watching YouTube. DO NOT game on battery power, as that will severely damage the cells.Performance: The 5600H is an excellent CPU for the money, and with SMT it is able to breeze through most of my requirements, but the same cannot be said of the GTX 1650. Although it is able to reach the refresh rate of the monitor on most eSports titles, it struggles to play through more demanding AAA games such as Cyberpunk 2077, where i was only getting 30fps on Medium settings. Meanwhile, I got 45fps at Medium settings in Control, and 120fps in Crysis. Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Terraria, Tomb Raider(2013), were all able to max out the refresh rate of the screen at their highest settings. I would strongly advise to upgrade the memory to a dual channel configuration as that would significantly improve the performance. Regarding thermals, the CPU did get quite hot while gaming(90C), but the heat was swiftly dissipated by the excellent cooling system. The GPU never throttled and always stayed under 75C.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their tactile keyboards, and this one is no exception. Has great travel distance and keystrokes feel snappy. The backlight comes in 2 levels, but I did not notice any difference in brightness between them (perhaps a defect). The touchpad was serviceable for daily tasks, but not for gaming.Verdict: On a whole, the new Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3 is an attractive options for gamers on a budget, with a sleek and professional design, great thermals and acceptable performance for the price. The keyboard is a stand-out in this price range, while the battery life is disappointing and below average in this class of laptops.",Harish,2022-01-21,Decent budget gaming machine with an elegant design.,366,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,cheap,2022,2022-01

 Just about yesterday, i have started to face an issue where the computer is not able to power up itself. Lenovo is about to send an engineer. Its sad. However, let my experience not hamper yours.Edit - The issue was fixed, and the support was superb. The ram while assembling had some oil on it which gradually, went on to give an issue. It has been replaced. The engg. was superb.Overall, the product is decent, but not for the price point. I have a lenovo ideapad with the i7 12 gen 16IAH7.Pros -1. Looks and feels like a legion. (The technician told me it is legion only)2. The specs are good and with 105 watt TGP 3060, you can play superb games. Also, future proof as well.3. It's a non rgb keyboard, meaning you can use it for professional use as well.4. I only play dota2, and i needed a laptop with good cpu performance. This PC has made life smooth.Cons -1. Battery is like a glass of water. You’ll need to play with the AC power connected.2. No MUX. Just the HDMI, if connected to an external monitor will use the dgpu. If you have a monitor with GSync support. Then its good.3. The fans are making some good loud sounds. They say good thermals, I'll say its okay. I don’t know, i play a CPU intensive game if that is the reason of heating (not a lot), but the fans go boom once I start my game.",Parabjit,2023-02-15,"My POV - It is a good laptop, but does not really justify the price.",21,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,expensive,2023,2023-02

I am very curious about how MSI tries to justify their answers. But I won't take away how good the laptop actually is. Even though it will probably drain your battery in less than 5 hours at high performance. It performs better than even a water cooled 3090Ti desktop with a 12900k (the best last GEN could offer). But is slower and less efficient to the newly launched M2 Max by apple in editing and web browsing. Overall the 4k mini-led screen paired with the RGB and cooling would still be of considerable value if sold below ₹4,00,000 today. As some of the components are only limited to a very small amount of laptops, even some desktops 2 years ago. So I rated it a two star.

Soon after that I handled video editing for some work. This laptop worked like a breeze. It handled all the huge sized videos with ease. I also used it to project the display onto a data wall and to my surprise, it extended the display instead of normal duplication. It made my work easy as i was able to do my work in background without anyone in audience knowing about it. Till now its a great experience, Battery life is obviously lesser due to i7 and GPU but gaming laptops will have lesser battery life anyway. The display screen is also good. It did not hurt my eyes even after long working on the screen. It looks and feels good. Its not flimsy, it looks very dated and has a good venting and cooling system.

You have to click quite hard and will be able to feel the 2 stage click procedure.10) After purchase, the initial setup process is a quite cumbersome. High speed internet is a requirement it seems. Tons of updates (Including drivers from dell website), windows updates are separate lots of setups (Nvidia panel updates separately), bloatware (McAfee) really is confusing for anyone not well versed with these things.11) The hinges seem quite good.

 Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager  and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop  as cool as possible.I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner. I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity.  For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.HP factory setting for this  laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card  as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller  or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease  the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again.  So I  used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop  temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C  and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling  at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500mAlso recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience.  I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for  xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.edit2:Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts  that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick.",Careful Buyer,2022-05-21,Overall Good Laptop for both medium-high graphic quality gaming and work/anything else,1385,Positive,HP,AMD,cheap,2022,2022-05

This is currently the best performance laptop you can buy in 50k-85k segment. And that's a huge claim, I know, but the Indian laptop market is that screwed at the moment. There are just no fair offerings in that segment and that segment is supposed to be multiple segments (like 50-60k, 60-70k, 70-80k and so on). Of course I'm leaving out RTX3050 laptops but I don't think they're priced well for what they're offering. The only other laptops that make sense would be 3050Ti ones due to their higher performance and even then, their pricetags are not proportional to the increase in performance when compared to this RX5500M laptop. You pay way more than the performance bump you get.Also, please remember to uninstall bloatware and stick to OEM graphics drivers instead of installing Radeon graphics drivers (because every laptop is different and parent companies know better about what drivers would serve their laptops better- speaking from experience with this very laptop).The Victus has a lot of things going for it. Remember, I bought this was like 48k in a sale so the features it has at that price point are a no-brainer.Pros:- Tiny bezel around the screen makes it feel so slick and modern- Screen size is plenty big and the screen quality is quite pleasant to look at- Backlit keyboard (white light only but that's not something I consider a con since I don't like RGB anyways)- Numpad included in the keyboard- Awesome thermals. It plays games like CSGO and Mudrunner on max settings without having to ramp up the fans so the experience is quiet and pleasant. Although, playing more demanding games like Snowrunner do tend to make it run hot so the fans spool up to higher RPMs (in which case you can just use noise-cancelling headphones to offset that issue).- Best in class CPU and graphics card. I added in another 8GB RAM stick and this thing is now unstoppable!-Soild build quality. I was attacked by a dog so hard that I got knocked back while this laptop was in my bag behind my back and when I fell, the bag was crushed under my weight. Not a scratch.- Minimalist design is very much appreciated. I hate loud, flashy, obnoxious designs from other brands screaming, ""LOOK AT MEEE!!!1!1!!"" so this subtle, subdued but still upmarket design is great for me.- People complain about this laptop's screen wobbling issue, especially while under a running fan. Sure, it's a thin screen so it's bound to happen but honestly, I don't see it. Yeah, it does wobble if you slap the screen gently but that's rare and also, why would you? I just leave the screen alone and do my thing. Haven't had a problem yet.Cons:- It's very heavy. At 2.5 kg, this thing is a behemoth. But I guess, you can't have everything. I'm okay with this being the only con to that many features at this price point.- Can't think of any other cons. In fact, I haven't had any other issues with it during the last 5 months of my ownership at all whatsoever so... that's great!Honestly, this is a great value for money laptop and I recently recommend it and got at least 3 other people to buy it. Not one of them has had an issue either. This laptop was one of the best strategies adopted by HP of late.

Tested with the new plague and rtx it was looking amazing running smooth ..got some crashed in high dense areas and had to lower rtx settings.Competitive Games will ran pretty good more than refresh rate of the screen with the good CPU GPU pair and fats ram . So no hiccups there.Ports:Bonus point for a thunderbolt c port..with fast 135watt charging . The biggest down side is there is only two USB A ports .Overall:It's a good laptop at the price segment the build is amazing quality and looks great.With good performance all across .

Soon after that I handled video editing for some work. This laptop worked like a breeze. It handled all the huge sized videos with ease. I also used it to project the display onto a data wall and to my surprise, it extended the display instead of normal duplication. It made my work easy as i was able to do my work in background without anyone in audience knowing about it. Till now its a great experience, Battery life is obviously lesser due to i7 and GPU but gaming laptops will have lesser battery life anyway. The display screen is also good. It did not hurt my eyes even after long working on the screen. It looks and feels good. Its not flimsy, it looks very dated and has a good venting and cooling system. It has a backlight keyboard as well and comes with office and windows 10 preloaded.Its a must buy and, in this price, its a win win situation.",aditya narayan,2022-10-09,ITS A BEAST!,121,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2022,2022-10

The display is definitely good (better than equivalent ASUS models). Will have to use it for a while to comment about its battery performance. The Lenovo vantage app didn't work at first, but a quick uninstall and reinstall fixed the issue and from there on I was able to fully test all three performance modes. The display has very minor backlight bleed towards the bottom, the rest appears just like regular IPS glow to me. The trackpad is pretty good. As far as games go, I've only tried Rocket League so far. Will update after trying some AAA titles in a week or so.Update: I've had it for 2 weeks now. Just want to post a quick update. The device has been great so far. It handles anything you throw at it effortlessly plus it stays relatively cool even when put it under stress (games, rendering etc.). I use a basic vertically elevated cooling pad with shitty fans and for me the CPU temps have never gone beyond 87-88 degrees even with air conditioning turned off. On cooler days or with A/C on, the CPU temps (under stress) with cooling pad stay right below 80. Battery backup for normal tasks is 4-6 hours. At this point, the only drawback I feel is the lack of extra USB ports - it has just 2 (might have to use a hub if you've got more USB devices to connect).",zee,2022-11-13,Just had it for one day so far.,41,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,expensive,2022,2022-11

That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular:CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDPDisplay - 165Hz, 100% SRGBPrice: Got it for 89,990Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to  add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings:World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settingsWitcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settingsForza Horizon 4 -  did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned aboveI am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too,  don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.",Sameer Sitaram Kharade,2022-10-29,Huge upgrade for me!,41,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,expensive,2022,2022-10

Performance/hardware - when it comes to Performance this machine is a real beast I simply have no complains as I did almost everything in it from editing huge videos to playing heavy games like GTA 5 on max settings for almost 5 hours continuously and haven't seen any lag in performance Ryzen 5 4600H coupled with Nvidia GeForce 1650 4gb graphics is a perfect combination for a midranger one could ever dream of in 2020 and best part is the new 512 gb SSD which is really superfast and give me an instant bootup in 7-8 seconds which is really impressive I simply have no complains with the hardware and the slots everything is perfect, the speakers are also quite good which really gives you a good listening experience and I gurranty you won't find all this at this price of 61K or even nearby this as most of the laptops till 75K are almost the same offering more or less same specifications like HP pavilion gaming or HP omen.2.) Display- my first impression when I saw this display was simply wowwwww believe me guys this laptop has got the one of the best Displays at this price bracket don't listen to the fake hype created on its display that it isn't good actually there is nothing like that yaa on paper this might not seem good to few guys especially sRgb value etc but believe me when you use it you fall in love with it actually one day when I was using my laptop suddenly my brother who is a professional creator came to see me he saw the new laptop and after that he started moving the cursor his first reaction was woww man this is 144hz display he was shocked as getting 144z display with this great specs in this price range was almost impossible then I compared my display with his Asus Rog I don't remember model name but it costed him almost 1 lakh 2 years back and you won't believe me mine display was much better than his in terms of everything he himself admitted this yaa this display isn't that color accurate so unless you are a content creator it won't affect you Infact you would fall in love with it see this laptop comes with a price of 61k and I gurranty you all laptops in this price range upto 85k comes with almost same display so there's isn't much difference now most of the guys are expecting an OLED 4k display at this price bracket which is almost impossible to get but yaa what you are getting is totally worth it.Rgb lighting keyboard takes your experience to next level it just makes this machine more beautiful especially when working in low light or dark.3.) Heating issues- see when you are buying a Lamborghini you won't complain that it makes big noise obviously when you have bought such a powerful machine it would heat up and that's normal with almost all the gaming laptops during heavy tasks they all go upto 85-90 degrees which is normal and these machines handle it well especially the AMD processors can bear upto 105 degrees few guys said that this laptop goes upto 95 degrees while gaming or doing heavy task I must say to them that there is an application called ryzen controller in which you can set temperature limit for 85 degrees and I gurranty it won't cross this limit ever without any loss in performance or gaming and it won't affect life of this laptop too I personally played GTA 5 on max settings for 4-5 hours continously and almost daily but I never faced any lag or performance drop even the temperature never crossed 80 degrees in my case when using ryzen controller and I was happy with it.4.) Battery life- yaa this that part which I hate the most about this laptop I didn't got that great battery life maximum 4-5 hours on normal minimal usage 2.5-3 hours watching movies and 1.5 hours max on gaming which I personally didn't liked but remember it's a gaming laptop and the day you decide to buy gaming laptop you have to make compromises with battery life as none of the gaming laptop would give you battery life equivalent to a professional laptops or notebooks when it comes to this laptop if you are doing gaming then I will only suggest you keep the turbo mode on and charger always connected with balanced battery settings from asus app this would be perfect combo if you try to do hardcore gaming without turbo mode then you might get some lags so make sure turbo mode is on and charger is always connected this is a big con in almost all the gaming laptops which I hate as I personally prefer big battery life in any device.5.) Webcam- it's not that good yaa keeping its price and specs in mind it won't affect you especially if you are a gamer but to be honest camera is ok not that good so unless you have to use the camera extensively most of the time it will work for you but if you are always busy up with camera I think then it would dissappoint you and you might need a new Webcam with it but I don't think this will be a deal breaker for you.6.) Build quality and looks- this machine is damn strong with military grade build which can bear a lot also its design is damn good and I would say if you planning to take it to college or any other place then you can easily carry it although it's bit heavy like most of the gaming laptops but to be honest I don't have any issues with its design and build quality I simply love it.7.) Brand value- at the end you get a brand value of asus and 1 year of warranty and as we all know how perfect and good asus laptops are it's another factor which convinced me to buy this beast.Final verdict🔥Believe me or not this is the best budget gaming laptop to buy in the current market steal this deal up as soon as possible and you won't regret in life even if you have 75k budget I would suggest you go for this as it would not only save your money but also give you almost same experience at a better price.",Abhinav Chaudhary,2020-10-15,Grab this beast now🔥,847,Positive,ASUS,Nvidia,cheap,2020,2020-10
52365,"ASUS TUF  Gaming  A15, 15.6-inch (39.62 cms) FHD 144Hz, AMD Ryzen 5 4600H, 4GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650,  Gaming  Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/90WHrs Battery/Windows 11/Black/2.3 Kg), FA506IHRB-HN079W",59490,89990,34,4,"I will skip on the repetitive comments in different reviews and mention only the things which were not mentioned there or didn't apply to the unit I received.1. In the user manual it is mentioned to charge the laptop 3 hours before the first use. This is to calibrate the battery and you will get decent battery backup. Gaming laptops have low battery backup because a major chunk of power is consumed by the dedicated GPU. Checked the MyAsus app on the laptop. They suggest using the laptop on direct power as much as possible, and for the maximum lifespan of the battery, they recommend max 60% charge, which the app can manage if you select the option.2. The display is bright enough, but there is some backlight bleeding, which is okay. You can check how much your unit has if you sit in a pitch dark room and are displaying only black colour on the whole screen, at full brightness. But know that you are not gonna get the best quality panels supporting 144 Hz Adaptive refresh rate at this price. Colour accuracy is only slightly off but looked good enough.People getting confused with the ""IPS level"" can set their minds at ease. ""IPS"" is a trademark of LG Philips which not everyone can use, but this is practically an IPS panel. It has great viewing angles. Keep it side by side to a TN (normal LCD) panel to see the difference. Blacks are way better than the normal LCD.3. Tried Hitman and PUBG Lite in max settings, and got no lag or ghosting. The air from the vents was hot while playing Hitman, but the laptop didn't feel warm anywhere except near the top intake vents where the VRMs are. Do note that I never turned on the turbo mode, as I don't think it makes sense to use overclocking on a device that is susceptible to heat too much.Also, nearly every GAMING laptop touches 90°C, even the Intel ones. Nothing to worry, as AMD processors can take 5°C more than Intel processors considering the maximum temperature limit.Update: Tried Watch Dogs 2 today, in Very High preset (ultra not supported in 4GB graphics). The CPU got to 94°C for a second, in performance mode. Started Turbo mode, which pushes the fans to 5700 rpm, and brought the temperature to 80-82, with occasional spikes to 90°C for 5-6 seconds. Didn't feel the fans were too loud. There were no throttling or frame drops, and the CPU was at 4 GHz and GPU was at 1695MHz throughout.Felt the air vents during this. There are intake vents even in the keyboard (check Asus launch video in CES). The vent at the back, in the centre, is also an intake vent.Along with the top intake vent, the keys 6,7, T and Y was also lukewarm to touch.4. No sticker bombs, no laptop bags included. Sticker bombs are only in Fortress grey model, and Asus is not giving bags with TUF A15 in India by default.5. The SSD in my unit is a WD SN530 NVME SSD, which is faaaaaast! One thing to note here that your unit may come with an SSD which is similar performing, but from a different manufacturer. This is a standard practice, as some part are supplied by multiple vendors and they are not advertised for the same reason. But they deliver similar performance.6. Remember registering the product at Asus warranty registration portal to update the warranty coverage period as per the date you bought it, and also to claim ongoing offers from asuspromo.in.7. While ordering it the serial number is updated in the printable order summary once your order is dispatched. Check the serial number on Asus warranty information portal to verify you are getting the right model. I had ordered this laptop before (17 Sept) and checked the serial number the day they dispatched. It was showing FX505, so I cancelled it the same day, and ordered again. I got the correct model now.8. Asus has allowed upgrading RAM, SSD, WiFi card and Hard Disk in warranty. Upgrades limited only to these components will not void it.9. Webcam is not good. Luckily I don't need it as much, and better than not having one at all.10. Facing a weird drivers issue, my usb 3 enable phone does not get detected on USB 3 ports. A combination of USB 2 & USB 3 device and port is working on all the ports. External hard disk which is USB 3 also works. (Update: Issue gone after system reset)11. It does have an inbuilt recovery partition. So in case you need to reset, no need to get into the clumsy process of creating a bootable usb and booting from it.",Devashish Gulati,2020-10-02,I had expected a good gaming laptop.

 I searched for the highest end laptop I can find in this price range, and this was by far the winner after a week of searching. Nvidia RTX 3060 and AMD Ryzen 7 6800H (Latest version in the 6000 series yet, released just a few months ago) together make for a great gaming experience. I didn't have to use a cooling pad even on the highest game graphics settings, as the GPU temperature never reached maximum. I also use it for rendering images and animations in Blender, and the GPU performs unbelievably fast. The RGB keyboard changes colors constantly. This along with a sleek finish gives the laptop a premium feel. It comes with lifetime Office and Windows 11. It has USB Type-C ports in addition to the USB 3.2 ports, so you can easily connect your phone if you have a Type-C one. The GPU can serve any graphic intense work, so it's perfect for learning animation, working with animation professionally, or using it for daily college work. The battery is 90 WHrs, so it lasts for a long time and charges to full in minutes.",Amazon Customer,2022-11-20,The best you can get for this price range,47,Positive,ASUS,AMD,expensive,2022,2022-11

I am very curious about how MSI tries to justify their answers. But I won't take away how good the laptop actually is. Even though it will probably drain your battery in less than 5 hours at high performance. It performs better than even a water cooled 3090Ti desktop with a 12900k (the best last GEN could offer).

Overall the 4k mini-led screen paired with the RGB and cooling would still be of considerable value if sold below ₹4,00,000 today. As some of the components are only limited to a very small amount of laptops, even some desktops 2 years ago. So I rated it a two star.

Ram is upgradable to 16gb ( it has one 8gb and the other slot is empty so you just have to buy an 8gb ddr4 3200mhz ram and intall it)6. Read and write speeds are also good as it has a Gen 4 Nvme SSD. ( upgradable to 2TB)7. Games also run really smoothly as it has a dedicated gpu GTX 1650. I tried Valotant and GTA 5, both gives great fps and lag free performance.8. Charging is really fast as it comes with a 150 Watt fast charger.Cons :1. The screen wobbles which sometimes feels annoying.2. Fan noise is present when you are gaming which can be turned off but you will get low performance after turning off fan noise. But cooling is really nice.Note : If you are looking for good battery life in a gaming laptop it is very much impossible as 99% gaming laptops use H-series processors that consume power and does not give good battery backup.If you play games simply connect to the adapter and play any game you want.Doing normal task and buying it for college life, then you can get decent battery backup.

Any work is executed smoothly without any hitches. 2) People looking for running multiple virtual machines simultaneously will be very pleased. I have tested with 6 VMs running simultaneously and truth be told, the laptop performs wonderfully well without any lags. 3) 16GB of DDR5 RAM is good enough for most work including latest AAA titled games. There is option to upgrade upto 32GB but it is a very costly affair right now. 4) The RTX 3050Ti is quite good for mid-tier gaming needs. Tons of youtube videos backup this point. However, for high level gaming this is not ideal. 5) The laptop gets noticeably warm even when doing normal tasks. However, while under intensive workload (CPU, GPU or both) the machine does get very hot. So, a good quality cooler is a must for those who intend to do intensive work for long periods of time.6) Alienware command center needs to be running in order to use the Game Shift tech (Fn + F9).7) Display Quality is ok - I expected a better display at this price.8) The integrated webcam does not have a privacy shutter which is drawback at this price point.9) The mouse click on the trackpad is a 2-stage affair. You have to click quite hard and will be able to feel the 2 stage click procedure.10) After purchase, the initial setup process is a quite cumbersome. High speed internet is a requirement it seems. Tons of updates (Including drivers from dell website), windows updates are separate lots of setups (Nvidia panel updates separately), bloatware (McAfee) really is confusing for anyone not well versed with these things.11) The hinges seem quite good.

Did lots of research and found out that we must compromise on something in 70K range. This is a value for money deal I believe. Found out there are some issues in competition like screen bleeding, so thought to stay away from other brands in this price range.You get Ryzen 4600h 5th gen (don't ne fooled by previous gen offers from others), 8gb RAM, SATA+SSD hard drives, backlit keyboard and important of all 144Hz screen. Initially my thoughts were what is the use of 144Hz screen but boy, it does make difference! Everything from browsing, gaming, typing and all windows animations look butter smooth. Very happy that I went for 144Hz screen! it's a bang for the buck and if you think it's a useless feature I beg to differ. I quiet like the design as well, before buying I was skeptical but in fact it works. Screen has a floating feel to it, and it is a tad bit taller than other laptops because of thicker chin. This makes the screen taller and it is in fact much better. You don’t have to slouch lower to stare at the screen. I would say the design elements are very ergonomic for day to day use. Additionally, with the processor, RAM and GPU combo highly unlikely that you will face a problem with processing power. No complaints there! The laptop is a bit heavy and feels bulky, but I guess that is Ok since it is a gaming laptop. Heat sinks are nice as well. The fans and the design keep the laptop cool. You feel the fans working with heavy processing, though it is not too intrusive. Backlit keyboard is a boon if you want to keep working and/or playing through the night without disturbing others. I like plain white backlit keyboard as in this one, it is classy and works best rather than any other very flashy color. Power button is backlit too. There are no glossy bits and I prefer that way; it looks clean and doesn’t feel fingerprint magnets. My previous laptop was glossy, and it used to attract everything. WebCam is okayish, can’t complain or write anything positive about it. It does the job.Surprisingly, keyboard is very nice to type on, decent travel and feels sturdy without worrying too much you can exploit it for fast typing. Although the build is all round plastic, overall the build feels sturdy. Let’s see how it fairs in the long run! Overall the impressions are positive for the laptop.I would advice to go with this one since there are no compromises at this price range. You get good processor (hexa core), GPU combo with decent RAM (can be upgraded later to 16Gb), combo hard disks SSD+SATA (SATA is clocked to 7200 rpm which is fast, others are providing 5400 rpm)! Plus, you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5, competition offers Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4! Although with my old router, I thought, I wouldn’t be able to notice net speed, but internet feels snappy on this device than my wife’s last year purchased Lenovo laptop. Only downside is, it has only 2 USB ports, I solved this by buying 220 rupees USB hub 😉 Type C, card reader slots however work fine, you get an ethernet port as well which is missing from so many recent laptops. Though the prices of laptops are going up with work from home being the norm now, I recommend investing in this.

After weeks and weeks of searching for the right laptop, I came across this and saw that 64,5k was getting me what sounded like a blistering experience (even with my limited knowledge of computer hardware at the time).ProcessorThe Ryzen 5-4600H this laptop comes with is currently 1 generation behind the latest lineup sold by AMD, but nonetheless it is an absolute bang for buck. It works flawlessly- everyday applications load at an instant, and performance-heavy games (Destiny 2, Control, Rocket League, Just Cause 3) load in about 20  seconds or less. This processor also has a huge market share, and is very popular. Of course, it's also blisteringly fast. It's even said to outperform previous-gen Intel core i7s!Graphics Processing Unit / GPUThe GTX 1650 is an excellent entry-level graphics card. AAA titles run fine on medium settings, Minecraft with shaders can run at 80-120 FPS on average. It won't run all games at the best graphic settings, but considering what you get, it's phenomenal.

In this case the setup is a 256 GB SSD with a 1 TB HDD.SSDs ensure faster (in this case extremely fast) computer boot-up times, and the hard disk, while slower in terms of storage, gives you the opportunity to store more games. So the total storage space is around 1100-1200 GB, which will get you by for years if you keep your storage usage in check.Other factorsScreen/monitor - 144 Hz refresh rate! Extremely smooth. There is a very noticeable visual difference between 60 Hz and 144 Hz. It's amazing, and it really adds to the gaming experience. Everything looks better. If you play fast-paced FPS titles, you will find that the higher refresh improves your success rates (admittedly only marginally) because the monitor will visually update more often and you'll be able to see more of what happens in front of you in-game.Sound - Good, better than what you'd expect from standard, in-built speakers. Plenty of base, reasonable clarity. The B&O audio control app comes standard, which is a nice-to-hav,e though personally I don't use it much.RAM - 8 GB is good enough for many games, though obviously for optimal performance you may like to install another 8 GB stick for a total of 16 GB. However with a browser like Chrome open, memory usage can hover between 60%and 80%.The only disadvantage here is that the maximum supported memory is 16 GB, making it unsuitable for very high-end editing, 3D modelling and other creative work. The standard for laptops is 8GB RAM nowadays, and naturally upgrading your RAM will give you an edge.AestheticsThe laptop is made of plastic, but it looks good overall regardless. The back-length of the laptop is angular, and there's a cool looking polygon motif around the speaker area in front of the keyboard. It's a nice touch. The keys are backlit with white lights. Sadly there is no RGB option, unlike the competing Acer Nitro laptops. I don't think I need to mention this but Windows 10 is a nice-looking operating system.TLDR/conclusionAll in all, if you're an emergent gamer, this is an excellent purchase and a laptop seriously worth considering. While in terms of hardware it doesn't compete with top-of-the-line gaming rigs, it has excellent value for money. Buy it either standard or on-sale, as I feel both are worth your money.",Protik,2021-07-11,It feels illegal to buy something this good for such an affordable price range,566,Positive,HP,Nvidia,cheap,2021,2021-07

I bought this laptop for a relative and after using it for a week before handing it over to them i was just blown away. My main concern was battery life and this laptop gave 10 + hours of mixed world uses on battery everyday. I never thought that in something this cheap the battery life could be this good. the CPU is excellent specially the integrated graphics. played Valorant on this. Had a similarly priced core i3 10th gen laptop for comparison with equal ram size. I was getting around 90 fps on the intel version and battery life of 4 hours only. On this i got 150 fps on average and many of my general tasks which are based on CAD based application run very well.

As a customer, why should I bear all these losses when there is no fault of mine.It was not a small issue to just let it off & get repaired under warranty, whereas the entire display unit & lvds was kaput within this short-time of usage which questions me on the MSI product quality & reliability and now post warranty repair, the product has lost its value as mentioned above.Note: As per the mail communication, MSI policy states ""As per MSI policy, refund or replacement can be done within 7 working days from the point of purchase. We do have only after repair services only.""Also, even if the product defect / fault is from MSI’s end, their policies are in such a way that they are all favorable to the company and not the customer who is at no fault as in my case.

It can handle everyrhing easily. So anyone want to buy laptop under 70k, I recomend you to increase 2k more and get this. you will get all round performance.

Extreme Gaming needs better cooling , either buy a cooling pad or use in AC environment (24°C to 27°C is good) .Till now I have used :-• Blender (created a forest, Donut, on Cycle Engine with enabled OpticX ) Thanks to RTX .....render speed is good but needed more RAM for processing...suggestions- 32 GB if using Blender or any other 3D software.• Days Gone (High settings)[without any cooling]• Forza Horizon 4 (Maximum settings)[in AC room]• Battlefield 1 (Maximum settings)[without any cooling]• Ace Combat 7 (Maximum settings)[without any cooling]• Call of Duty MW Remastered (Maximum settings)[without cooling]Conclusion:-Pros1.

Extensive packaging, fast (less than 48hrs) and safe delivery.Cons:1) The YouTubers were right when they said the display wobbles. My high-speed ceiling fan was enough to make it wobble. If that's a deal breaker for you, skip the Victus lineup.2) The display rendered colours too warmly. White web pages were rendered cream-coloured. This isn't a problem cuz we could calibrate it ourselves from the display settings, but it's odd that this wasn't done out of the box.3) The backlight on the keyboard is blindingly bright. I couldn't find any option to adjust the brightness.4) The battery life is mediocre. Need to charge it at least twice a day if you're gonna spend most of your waking hours on it.Pros:1) The specification on both Amazon and HP's websites claimed this specific model (16-0351AX) had the RTX 3050 GPU. But the one I got was the RTX 3050 ti (the more powerful version of the 3050).2) The keyboard has a clean style (I like the font of the letters on the keys) and is well spaced. Good tactile feedback. The touchpad is large, smooth, and functional.3) The processor, Ryzen 7 5800H, is unbelievably powerful. Did some light gaming (Football Manager 2021, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Checked HP's built-in Omen software to see how the GPU, CPU, and RAM were faring. The GPU (avg around 45°C) and RAM were at 50%, but the CPU was barely troubled (around 10-15%, avg around 38°C). Unbelievably powerful. The thermals are designed well, nothing got too hot. The fans are set to 'auto', and I could barely hear them. They're pretty quiet and non-intrusive. I toggled the fan speed to 'Max' from HP's Omen settings just to check if they run. When set to max, they're loud and powerful enough to be used as a table fan.I intend to play more demanding games, will update this review after a while.4) HP's calling this the Mica Silver colour. It's matte black. They should just call it matte black. It's neat, understated, and minimalistic. When most gaming laptops look like they're part of the traffic signal lights, you can carry this variant to business meetings and not look like a clown.5) Comes with Microsoft Office 2019. I wasted a few minutes looking for a product key on the laptop and its packaging. But that's not necessary. Just open the Microsoft Word application and it'll auto-verify the in-built product key.6) The anti-reflective coating on the display is great.7) The 512GB SSD here is fast. There's a vacant NVME slot in the laptop too, so can add another 512GB SSD if necessary.8) HP collaborated with Dropbox to give 100gb free cloud storage for a year for those who bought this laptop.",Xylophone,2022-03-30,"If you're okay with a wobbly display, then this laptop is a phenomenal purchase.",289,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2022,2022-03

There is some flex at the center of the keyboard but nothing major. The design is very understated and looks clean in my opinion. The screen wobbles but not as much to render it unusable. The HDMI port connects directly to the NVIDIA graphics, bypassing OptimusScreen - Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for the 100%srgb variant of the display, you will seriously thank your eyes. The display is very nice with good colors and solid brightness. The 250 nits variant will disappoint you guys, it's not *just* 50 nits less than the 300 nits variant. Nit count is not linear, it's logarithmic. The display out of the box had a slightly yellow tinge but than can easily be fixed in the AMD software.Performance and thermals - The R7 5800H does not break a sweat no matter what you throw at it. It's so darn fast that it almost bottlenecks the RTX 3050. In other words, the RTX 3050 would be sweating at 100% usage while the r7 5800h would be chilling at 25% usage. Talking about thermals, the CPU does reach 100 degrees Celcius if you are playing a demanding game(Ryzen chips go up to 105 degrees) but it's nothing to worry about. The WASD area stays cool. The fans will make noise and if you are in a quiet environment, I would recommend a pair of headphones for a better experience.Battery Life - Don't expect wonders here, 4-5 hours on light usage. Maybe 6 hours if you change it to 60hz but nothing too special.Some things I did not like: 1. The bottom bezel could have been smaller 2. The keyboard backlight is blindingly bright, there is no option to toggle the brightness of those LEDs, It's just on or off. 3. 2 USB ports on the right side 4. It's heavy (but that's subjective)Software Included - MS Office 2021 [Lifetime] Dropbox 100GB [1 year] ExpressVPN [1 month] AlexaAll in all, a solid laptop. 8.5/10",Anonymous,2022-10-16,"Good laptop for 1080p gaming but not on ultra, it will hit its VRAM limits",289,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2022,2022-10

Got it from the Asus website in Jan 2022 specifically for Elden Ring (my 5yr old laptop was slowing down). Was able to play Elden Ring at the highest settings after recent game updates.I was able to play most games at highest settings possible, for certain games you'll have to learn to optimize the settings on your own though. eg. Red dead redemption 2, had to optimise the graphics settings to get a consistent frame rate at 75fps even though the game is optimized for AMD cards. Older games run absolutely smooth.Usage info: you need to have an understanding of drivers and how to install/re-install them to make this laptop work for you.Make sure to buy a laptop stand with fans as this one generates a lot of heat.Even the ambient room temp can cause problems especially above 30°, so sometimes you'll have to run the AC to cool things down.Since it doesn't have a camera you should buy one separately (inbuilt cameras are bad either way). I got a good deal on an Asus promotional site for a HP module, check YouTube videos for thr info. Also got extended warranty from there at a big discount. The Asus store listing is 155k but 10k higher on Amazon for some reason (scalping probably )Pros: because of the AMD cards it is quite cheaper compared to intel+Nvidia laptops,12GB of graphics ram is overkill and worth it in the long run.Solid build and good design.Asus rewards available at times for redemption for games.Cons: 1) this comes with a Mediatek wifi card which tends to stop working and take lower internet speeds than what is available. eg i have a 150Mbps connection yet it was maxing out at 10Mbps when i first used it. You'll need to solve this problem on your own through upgrading the driver software and using certain cmd commands to reset some settings.2) Asus software optimizations are lacking compared to its Lenovo Legion counterparts.3) Most games you play are Nvidia optimized.4) You have to be a bit tech savy to make this laptop work in an optimal manner.Make sure to watch JarodTech's vidoes on YouTube on how this laptop compares to others in different games.Simplified verdict, if you dont know how to solve computer problems or have extra money to spend, then buy the Lenovo Legion series. And if you are good at solving computer issues and want to save some money without compromising on performance buy the Asus Advantage Edition laptop.",Shreyas Surve,2022-10-04,"Worth buying, very good performance while gaming, lacking software optimizations though",12,Positive,ASUS,AMD,expensive,2022,2022-10

But Amazon is giving ability to write review even without buying it.Edit: I have bought it and now it's being shipped.Edit 2 (Review) :  This laptop is a beast! The GPU, Display is damn awesome. Those who are going to buy this one already knows all the pros of this laptop fron reviewers, as it's priced as high tier 3060 but performs close to 3080 or 3070Ti.  But I will list some cons about this machine.1. You need to be a Tech Savvy to optimize this laptop. Asus's own Performance and Turbo mode is bad and you will get Thermal Throttling if you use them. Instead you need to use Manual Mode to unlock the potential of laptop.2. The Fan of this laptop can go 7500 to 8000 RPM, but asus has locked tohe fan speed to 6500 RPM max via bios update, and this is a bad move from Asus Side. This one needs adequate cooling (if you want best performance) but the worse thing is you can't get full 7500 RPM even via Manual Mode. Asus must fix this.3. Don't panic if you see 95°c CPU temps as it's Max Limit is 105°c, but you can certainly limit it via Manual Mode (by lowering CPU tgp and increasing fan speed).4. Keyboard is very good for gaming but not for heavy typing (As I am not used to big size keys, but it's personal opinion, not a con) These were a few cons i faced (tho I solved it after lots of Reddit and YouTube Guide), but thr performance I get after that is unbelievable! Also an added bonus: Unlike Nvidia, AMD's graphics driver gets better day by day and support their customer for a long period of time. Whereas Nvidia stops caring for their old gpus after a few years.Also AMD is lot better for Linux as they are way more open source than Nvidia.Final Verdict: Go for it!",Priyajit Ghosh,2022-09-23,This one is Hell of A Beast,12,Positive,ASUS,AMD,expensive,2022,2022-09

No Major Issues in my 1 month of useBuild Quality 3.5/5  - Nice and Compact, really light weight. Looks gorgeous However, there is a bit of creaking here and there. The lid does wobble a bit when you open the hinge. Maybe I am nitpicking because my previous laptop was a ThinkPad and I am used to that level of build quality.Display 4/5 - Really bright, excellent ips panel. Viewing angles excellent. Probably you can't get a better display even with a 60k laptop in terms of quality. However, one con is that it is not anti-glare. It is highly reflective. Need to apply an anti-glare coating which costs another 500. Smudges also accumulate very easily. It is very easy to scratch the display, so I would advise you to get an anti-glare screen guard as soon as possible.Performance 4.5/5 - No issues at all. Ryzen 3 5300 is at par with i5 10th gen and the iGPU is even better than that on the i5 10th gen ones. i3 11th gen is not even a competitor to this cpu.  I always use it in battery saver mode and use 2-3 apps like notepad, MS Office, Chrome, with 10+ tabs and it hasn't lagged even once in 1 month of use. I mostly use it for office work and haven't done any intensive task at all (don't plan to do so too). Will probably handle all kinds of softwares, coding and stuff. My advice would be to not use it for gaming at all. Even though you will probably be able to play high-end titles in medium settings, don't tax the laptop. This isn't meant for gaming and you are just reducing the life of your laptop. Just invest 5-8k more and you will get dedicated gaming laptops with same or better performance.Battery 5/5 - Honestly can't expect a better battery backup from any laptop across any price range. As I told, I use it in battery saver mode with low brightness (I use it indoors) and it can give me 10 hours of battery life with wifi and office work (no bluetooth also as I don't use any bluetooth mouse or bluetooth earphones) so, battery is your prime concern, you really can't go wrong with this laptop. Another cool thing is the charging time. It is rapid. Can charge the laptop 0-100% in 90 minsCamera 4/5 - No issues here also. Perfect for video calls, meetings. Honestly, I have seen other reviews mention camera quality isn't good but I honestly don't think so. Maybe they are expecting quality like their phone front cameras which isn't necessary at all for online classes or office meetings only. There is a small flash too which you can turn off if you want. I think that's a handy touch. Mic also works very well. I am clearly audible to everyone in the meeting.Keyboard and Trackpad 4/5 - No major issues here also. Keyboard does look a little flimsy and keys wobble slightly but nothing major at all. Typing experience is very good. Backlight is a major bonus. There are two modes of backlight, the dimmer version will suffice for 90% of the time. Trackpad is excellent and detects even the smallest of movements. Sometimes it is too sensitive. There is slight creaking in the right click and left click buttons but that's excusable I think.Conclusion 4/5 : You really can't get a better deal than this for 40k. Ryzen 3 5300 + HP brand and after sales service + Insane battery make this a no-brainer decision to make if you are looking for a laptop in this price range.PS : Look for laptop maintenance tips and battery maintenance tips on YouTube to get the most out of your laptop in the long-run",Hemanth Kumar,2021-06-18,Best Laptop Under 40k - Detailed Review After 1 Month of Use,495,Positive,HP,AMD,cheap,2021,2021-06

Even premium laptops do not have a Samsung SSD, while this one does.It has a beautiful Backlit keyboard.Screen to body ratio is decent.Camera quality is decent, do not expect way too much.I could open 20 tabs on chrome, 5 Excel worksheets and the system worked fastest ever, thanks to SSDBoot is way too quick. 8 secondsBattery backup is solid as it lasts 5 to 7 hours depending on your usage.It has a Ryzen 3 5300 processor, with a 7mm nano technology. This is way too good in comparison with i5It has a built in Alexa :)It comes with pre installed Windows 10 and MS Office Student and home 2019, don't forget to activate it.Cons:Build quality is average. The body is full plastic, could have been better but you can't really complain for this price.Anti glare is a con provided by everyone, but you can overcome this by applying an anti glare screen guard. I don't think it matters too much.SSD usable storage is only 434 GB, as windows 10 consumes decent amount.Trackpad using is a bit uncomfortable I felt due to the plastic body, I use a wireless mouse.I wouldn't recommend heavy gaming as this is not a gaming laptop, however you can go for mild gaming sport. Conclusion: Overall this is a terrific purchase, if your budget is within and around 40k, go for it blindly. I read tons of reviews for tons of devices before buying, I am sharing the honest review. This is value for money.Also, just a tip- you'll need to get your warranty updated because HP calculates warranty period from the date when unit was shipped.All you have to do is contact HP support on Chat, share your proof of purchase via email and your warranty is updated in 24 to 48 hours.

Here is a quick review after spending couple of days with the laptop. Build quality of the laptop is not so great especially the keyboard, I am comparing it with hp ProBook 440 G4 which I'm already using. Battery backup is approx 7-8 hrs with light work and screen brightness to midium and backlit keyboard off. Laptop hardware is very good no doubt about that. It's very reasonably priced on this date when I purchased, in future price may increase. You get performance almost equivalent to i5 11th Gen which cost approximately 15k-20k more. Only drawback is, it has Bluetooth is 4.2, it should have been at least Bluetooth 5. It has WiFi 5 and very much compatible with 5ghz dual band home routers, so I don't consider this as a drawback. Screen is very reflective it dont have matte finish like my ProBook has, it has colour only upto 45% NTSC gamut with 6 bit detail as compared to stand alone monitors which are much better with 72% NTSC gamut and 8 bit detail, so basically it justify the price at which it's available. Ram is upgradable to 16GB, Samsung NVME SSD is provided and it's upgradable, but no extra slot for SSD or 2.5 inch sata HDD available in this laptop. If you do normal office work or teams and zoom video sessions you will not be able to observe any huge difference in processing with i5 11th Gen or AMDs own 5500u where both of the laters cost 10k to 20k more.

The summary is given directly below and the detailed review is given after. This should cover most of the details you might want to know so its recommended to read completely.Pros:Very good performance both GPU and CPUExcellent 120hz fluid display.Very fast and capable 512 GB SSD.Good Design including the RGB Keyboard.Somewhat satisfactory Batter Life.Easy to open and upgrade.Cons:Less than capable track-pad.Poor WebcamHeating issue out of the box for the CPU ( A solution included below).Color accuracy of display is not great.Very primitive BIOS that is very incapable.Detailed review:I wont be getting into the specs of most of the components as its easily available in the product description.The SSD is the Intel 660P which comes with a direct read and write speed of 1 GB/s and 0.8 GB/s respectively. Copy speed within the same SSD is around 400-450 MB/s which is still almost 10 times as fast as the normal HDD. The system starts up within 5 seconds and loading speed of games are quite good.The GPU is excellent has very good performance in most titles. I am able to get the following frame rates in a few games I tested: Assassins Creed Unity: 60 fps; 1080p; HIGH . Rise of the Tomb Raider 75+ fps; Very High Custom; 1080p . PES 2018: 60 fps (locked); Max Settings; 1080p.The Display has remarkable viewing angle and has respectable brightness. The matte cover helps very much in visibility even during mid day. The 120 hz refresh rate is a game changer especially if you ant to play games like PUBG, Apex Legends, etc. The color accuracy is below average but don't take it to mean that the display is bad. It is still very vibrant and very good for entertainment purposes. But if you are buying this for professional editing work, expect some limitations in use cases.The Keyboard is RGB supported but not individually lit or even zone lit, The entire key board will have one color at a time but that color can be any of 16 million options or you can set it to cycle through the colors as well. The typing experience is good but not excellent. Expect to make some mistakes while typing as the spacing is not the same as desktop keyboards. The travel distance is fine but the keys are not firm so it feels like you quickly reach bottom level.The speakers have very good quality for the price even though it doesn't get very loud. The port selection is good but would have preferred a USB type - C and SD Card reader. The webcam is pretty low end and is just usable. Wifi is fast and is the Wave 2 type which is almost Gigabit level and has low latency which makes it somewhat capable for online gaming.The laptop is easy to open and upgrade as all the main components can be reached just by opening the bottom panel but take care not to scuff the edges when the panel is removed as it is quite tight.Now coming to some of the issues:The track-pad is below average and I have had sensitivity issues out of the box that required a little bit of tinkering to get used to.The BIOS seems very amateur with just some animations and color which I don't care about. What i do care about is that it offers enough control over the system. For example out of the box the VRAM shared memory is set to 2GB. Even  though windows can manage this pretty well to ensure that no bottleneck happens, the problem becomes apparent when trying to play legacy games like PES 2018 which doesn't detect this as dynamic shared memory. Most laptops' BIOS offer the option to select dynamic shared memory or put a very fixed low VRAM memory like 64 MB which I would have preferred to avoid getting errors and warnings. But the BIOS in this laptop seems very less capable.Then the next problem I had was with heating. I expected very good temperatures from the CPU as the Ryzen generally has very good efficiency. But I found out that even in Turbo mode with the fans at max speed, the Ryzen  can get as hot as 90-94 degree Celsius while gaming. The solution to this problem is to go into advanced power management and set maximum processor state to 99% which would prevent the Cpu from boosting. This would definitely reduce performance by 5-10% but the temperatures will be amazing at around 65-70 degrees stable. I would have preferred asus to include dual heatpipes on both fans instead of a total of 3 Heatpipes.Battery backup is average. Under battery saver mode and very low brightness you can expect 4-5 hrs of life. 3-4 on medium brightness and 2-3 on heavy workloads. Gaming would probably run the juice out in 1-2 hrs.Now for the conclusion:I have not mentioned the price so far as that is one of the highlights of the lap. Just taking performance into account just 1-2 years ago a laptop with same performance would have easily cost more than 80k . Not to mention features like Intel  512 GB SSD, RGB keyboard, 120hz Display, GIGABIT WIFI, etc . Compared to that this is a stellar deal. Its not without its problem like I mentioned above. But those are comparatively minor grievances and not deal breakers for most people. At the time of buying this, month of June, 2019, I can pretty much say there is no laptop in this range that offers so much features with so little compromises.P.S: The laptop with 3750h is not much of an upgrade over this as it only has boost clock advantages and it only usually comes with 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD. In my opinion this is the best price and model for the fx505dt.",AKRS,2019-06-11,The best laptop at this price range with unique features with only minor grievances.,1778,Positive,ASUS,AMD,average,2019,2019-06
14526,"ASUS TUF Gaming FX505DT 15.6 inches FHD 144Hz Laptop GTX 1650 4GB Graphics (AMD Ryzen 5-3550H/8GB RAM/512GB PCIe SSD/Windows 10/Stealth Black/2.20 Kg), FX505DT-AL106T",66545,75990,12,4,"I plan to give a detailed review here but before that some important points in general.1. If you're looking for a credible review of this laptop, then try Asus-TUF-Gaming-FX705DT review at notebook check. It's for the 17-inch version of this model, but trust me the performance remains same.2. Much thanks to the authors of many other amazon reviews here which enabled my purchase with confidence.3. bit of an advice for all laptop buyers. always look for bundled offers while purchasing laptops. extended warranty offer of 1+2 year for 2500 rupees is gold. every laptop I’ve seen had its screen or some other part replaced in the first 2 years. a full hd screen costs about 8k in an authorized service centre. then there is partner offers from intel and Nvidia, probably free games and software. most of these bundles had to be claimed during the purchase or within 10/30 days of the purchase. so, research carefully and ask the seller for an invoice with product serial number included as soon as the item is delivered.4. if you got anything useful from this review then upvote it, so that more people can see it easily. if there is any mistakes or confusion, drop a comment below the review from amazon website (no comment option in the app I believe). I will try my best to correct it.5. If you want my review of fx505dt only, skip next two paragraphs.Now I don't expect everyone to read this review till end because time is a valuable factor. Here is my final word about this product. It's the best buy for a budget of 50k and below. I got it for 50k at special sale on Jan 2020. I guess its price will drop a bit more in coming sales because newer models with 1660ti and next gen amd processors are launching soon.Confused with Y540, NITRO, PAVILION 15?don't buy pavilion. It's out of question. Nitro got metal but also mid fan setup and heat issues. Y540 is in my opinion the best but the price should be the deciding factor. Go for y540 or nitro if the price difference to tuf fx505 is less than 8k. Paying any higher than that is not significantly worth it since you are still getting a 1650 gpu and a mediocre display. (even if you're playing at high/medium settings, having a 92% to 100% sRGB value display makes lot of difference. Even I was once in denial about the need for better displays, so I’m sure it's the kind of thing you need to see for yourself to believe) Shell out a few more bucks and go for a 1660ti at those price brackets. Current scenario 60k to 80k price bracket don't offer much 1660ti options but I guess it will change soon.Next part of my review talks about tuf fx505dt 512gb SSD version. What I did are - stress test on CPU+ GPU simultaneously, test 512gb SSD, play Witcher 3, assassin's Creed Odyssey, gta5.Build & appearance - plastic build, lid has some metal like pattern, can't open lid with one hand. Maybe because it doesn't have hdd weight. Lid logo won't light up. Overall laptop size and weight is okay, but not comparable to light weight. Lid closed, the laptop hides the gamer identity very well. But lid open, the plethora of stickers on the right side of track pad doesn't help much. And also, there is a Russian tattoo look like tuf logo printed far right end. Still it doesn't scream like predators while booting. So, I say it can mix well with office.Noise & heat - one shared main heat pipe and one small heat pipe for gfx card. There is no side vent. Fans are at both ends, and has good rpm also. Noise levels at silent and performance modes are tolerable but turbo noise will be irritating to others. Still less fan noise than predator series. Heating is negligible, when gaming you feel a bit warm on the keyboard than it was while silent. But that's it, keyboard won't get any more warm or hot as it gets on some i7 or i5 laptops after half hour or 1-hour mark. Thermals are really good. I have seen the thermals of fx504, so I don't believe its Asus credit, but low power consumption of amd CPU and Turing architecture gpu might be the reason.Display & speakers - display is from panda and model no. LM156LF-GL03. It's a 120hz ips panel with nearly sRGB 64% and adobeRGB 44%. so, it's a budget panel, do not compare it with high end models. There is no PWM and brightness is about average 220 nits, so won’t do much good outdoors. During gaming bright reds feel like orangish and all blue appear somewhat greyish. But it's much better than TN panels and 120 hz gives a buttery smooth feeling for the eyes if you are ready to lower the settings. I played gta5 at full setting the fps was about 40, then I lowered the settings to high I was getting about 78 fps and it made the whole viewing experience much better. My eyes felt less strain and were restful. So, it's a personal choice. Speakers are average, nothing good ever comes from them. But they do the job when you have no headphones. You better carry headphones because in public spaces the speakers are totally useless.Keyboard & ports - you get a one zone RGB aura keyboard from ASUS. You can change colors using armoury crate software installed in laptop. (it's a bit tricky see note 1 below at the end of review) It's designed like a full-sized keyboard. But you can see the right side of keyboard is crammed up to fit the number pad. Overall, it's a good keyboard for the price. There is moderate flex in the middle of keyboard while typing. Port selection is underwhelming and probably the most negative aspect of this laptop. But that's how all tuf are designed. There are ports only at the left side. 1 usb 2, 2 usb 3 and the usual HDMI 2, lan ports. Kensington lock option at right side I believe. So again, it's a personal choice. I'm sure everybody is going to miss the type c port.Ram & SSD - my device got an 8 gb single channel 3200mhz micron ddr4 ram with a latency of 17. I guess it's a joke from ASUS. Put a 3200mhz chip in a motherboard that only support 2400mhz just because ASUS made a bulk purchase. SSD is also from micron. It's an average one also. But much better than older predator Hynix SSD. See attachment picture for read write speed benchmark.CPU & GPU - the best part of this laptop is the Ryzen 3550h with base clock frequency 2.1ghz to turbo frequency of 3.7ghz and the gtx1650 4gb gpu with base frequency 1400 to turbo 1560mhz. during my benchmark stress test gpu was able to hold its base frequency of 1400mhz. during gaming gpu turbo even went as high as 1870mhz. you average about 1700mhz playing Witcher 3 at highest settings. same time CPU will run at 3600 to 3700mhz during all gaming. the point is there is no significant performance drop after playing for 1-2 and more hours continuously. I tested fps and frequency in game using msi afterburner and it was showing a power limit on gpu. I don’t exactly know what it is but I guess in future updates if ASUS removes that limit the gpu can turbo more. I have read from other reviews that CPU cannot be undervolted but gpu can be undervolted or made to increase 100mhz on freq.Gaming -Witcher 3- 40 to 45 fps on ultra-settings with NVidia hairworks on and hairworks AA set to 4.Gta5- 35 to 40 fps with almost everything set to maximum.AC Odyssey- 23 to 30 fps with environmental details & volumetric clouds set to very high, fog medium, character detail ultra-high, all remaining settings high. there were minor stutters and also, I started fresh so I believe after you reach big cities the fps might drop further.I played for more than 3 hours continuously, I’ve never noticed temperatures of CPU going above 82C and gpu 73C.Note that I'm running single channel ram. The notebook check review said dual channel increased Odyssey ultra-setting fps. my bios is version 308. drivers all updated to date 20 Jan 2020. also, I’m using an amazonbasics ventilated laptop stand, but I don't keep it raised, in fact I’m not even using its hinge which is still folded completely like factory default model.Stress test - I ran prime95 and furmark simultaneously to push my system to 100 percentage loads on both CPU and GPU for 1 hour. I tried pressing f9 in furmark to take screenshots but some reason it didn’t work. maybe someone else will post screenshots later. I’m too lazy to run benchmark for another hour. notebook check review I mentioned at the start may have screenshots I believe.TIME CPU GPUStart 3600 15005 min 3450 144084C 73C pow lim10 min 3100 140086C 73C pow lim20 min 3075 142582 73 pl30 min 3325 144082 73 pl40 min 3100 141586 73 pl50 min 3300 144083 73 pl60 min 3325 144082 72 plso, to conclude in the stress test CPU got 82-86C hot while also maintaining turbo frequency of 3.1 to 3.4 GHz while the gpu was much cooler the whole test time maintaining a base frequency of 1400mhz at temperatures of 73C.A FEW BUGS/ISSUES I'VE NOTICED1. the Wi-Fi experience is troubled, you'll notice Wi-Fi sometimes disconnects as soon as you connect. then sometimes Wi-Fi gets disconnected after a minute you get connected. anyway, all these issues happen within a few minutes of connecting to Wi-Fi. I think it's a problem with ASUS or tuf series.2. sometimes you get BSOD error when you continue the session from sleep because the SSD was put to sleep and it failed to get back online. it can be prevented by going to windows settings and changing SSD sleep state to never.3. the mouse pointer/cursor micro stutters sometimes when laptop is in silent mode. I’m not sure if its my item’s fault or a generic bug.NOTE1- to change keyboard aura effect and colors, go to armoury crate software and follow these steps – Device > system > lighting.Here is a little BONUS for reading to the end of review, if you buy ASUS laptop with 16 series graphics cards, ask ASUS online chat in MyAsus app to get an in-game costume in PUBG. It’s an ongoing promotion for laptops purchased till 31st Jan.  There is another game bundle from AMD where you can pick between Borderlands 3 PC or Outer worlds. But for that you need a coupon code (supposed to be given with the purchase) from the seller/ASUS. don't forget to visit asuspromo website for warranty extensions within 15 days of purchase. sadly, amazon didn't allow me to include any links.",Vishnu VP,2020-01-29,"Best Gaming laptop for 50k- entry level, budget gamers this machine is for you.",1778,Positive,ASUS,AMD,average,2020,2020-01
64190,"Dell G15-5525 Gaming Laptop, R7-6800H, 16GB DDR5, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti (8GB GDDR6), 15.6"" (39.62Cms) FHD WVA AG, 165 Hz 300 nits, Win 11+ MSO'21, Phantom Grey (D560898WIN9S, 2.51Kgs)",158990,206581,23,4,"This is a good laptop. For a 1.6lakh laptop, its appearance is very ""barebones"", i.e. it does not have a fancy RGB keyboard, nor a fancy paint job. It has powerful hardware that does what it is supposed to: play games well.This is my first relatively high end gaming laptop. For those like me who've never had a high end laptop before, a few things:i.) The charging adaptor comes with a 16A plug. This means that you cannot plug it into your normal electrical sockets like you plug in ordinary non-gaming laptops. You have to plug it into the bigger sockets which are meant for your microwave etc. However, you can still safely use them on a normal socket (which is what I do) by using a 6A to 16A converter socket (they cost like Rs.150-300). So, if you're buying this, buy one of those too. The charger is like a brick in terms of surface area (a third of the width of a brick of course). It's a fair bit bigger than the charger of a normal laptop.ii.) This laptop works well if you're playing games at 1080p with everything set on high (sometimes ultra settings depending on the game). However, turning on Ray Tracing can cause unplayable levels of stuttering in 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 games (which are poorly optimised for PC). Remember, a laptop RTX3070Ti is similar in performance to a desktop 3060Ti (slightly slower than a desktop 3060Ti actually). Don't expect desktop RTX3070Ti performance. Apart from that, everything else is just fine. I have not faced any touchpad related issues like the other reviewer.iii.) By default, there is only one power plan in the system, ""balanced"". This may lead to your GPU getting throttled to maximum 45W power consumption leading to lower framerates (you can check this by opening GeForce Experience, then selecting the Settings gear, and then enabling the In-Game Overlay option. From there, click Settings --> HUD Layout and choose what parameters like FPS, GPU Wattage etc. you want to see).If you do not unlock the other power plans like ""High Performance"" and ""Ultimate Performance"", you might get lower FPS due to power throttling. Google how to do this and select the appropriate power plan.Also, in Nvidia Control Panel, in either Global or Program Settings (depending on what you want), set the ""Power Management Mode"" option to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"".If you find your GPU power throttling to 45W for whatever reason, enable/disable Nvidia Optimus in the BIOS (if it's enabled, disable it, if it's disabled, enable it). This will reset your GPU power consumption back to normal (140W max). Also, the FPS you get with Nvidia Optimus disabled is greater than the FPS you get with it enabled.Another thing is, when playing graphically demanding games, if you live in an area with high temps like I do, keeping the air conditioner on in the room prevents power/thermal throttling of the GPU. The thermal throttling temperature for the GPU is 77C (this is done to prevent hardware degradation due to overheating). If the AC is on, you can play continuously for as long as you want at full GPU power (especially with a cooling fan, though it is not strictly required) without it reaching this temperature. This is because the laptop fans are able to suck in cooler air from the outside to cool the components inside. You can use GeForce experience to verify this (i.e. compare the GPU temps with the AC on and off). Otherwise, it will inevitably reach 77C and throttle to 45W and you will have to go into the BIOS over and over again to reset the power consumption when power throttling takes place and you can't play at full power for a long duration in one go.Even a 45W down-throttled GPU will give you acceptable framerates in most games (not all), but it just isn't as smooth as the GPU running at full power. For some games, you definitely need the GPU at full power to get acceptable framerates at high settings (especially if you're turning on Ray Tracing).iv.) This laptop comes with something called Game Shift mode or G-mode. G-mode makes your fans run faster which lowers your GPU temperature. This can improve GPU performance by keeping the GPU cooler. To enable/disable G-mode, press Fn+F9. If you're using the GPU and playing at full power, you need to turn on G-mode unless you want the temperature to increase (which it inevitably will after a few minutes of gameplay (you can see how the temp spikes on the GeForce experience HUD layout)). Once the temperature goes beyond a certain point your GPU will auto-throttle down to 45W again. So, make sure to turn on G-mode when playing very heavy games. Not all games need it. But some do. You can make out when you play them and monitor the temperature.v.) If you've never used such a high-end gaming laptop before and the fans sound like a small jet plane when you turn on the system or play a game, don't panic. It's supposed to sound that way and it's safe. G-mode might be on. Turn it off and it gets quiet. You will eventually get used to the sound of the fans when G-mode is on.vi.) The only thing I'm disappointed by is the keyboard design choice. At least for this laptop, Dell could have given us full-sized arrow keys (or at least not kept ""pg up"" and ""pg down"" right above the left and right arrow keys). See attached pic for details.This is currently the cheapest laptop for the configuration and GPU that it provides and it's well worth buying over the other even more expensive ones. It's a good thing that this laptop comes with an FHD (1080p) screen instead of a QHD (1440p) screen. A laptop 3070Ti isn't really powerful enough for QHD on modern titles and will be even less so as we go into the future and games require even more computing power. 1080p resolution on a QHD screen won't look as good as it does on an FHD screen.Overall, I'm satisfied.",Amazon Customer,2023-02-28,Good laptop.,3,Positive,DELL,Nvidia,expensive,2023,2023-02

On full stress test cpu was hitting 92-94 which is normal for any high end gaming laptop.Gpu temps were in mid 60's in less demanding titles to high 70's in heavy games without any throttling.Fans - silent mode is amazing.

Fans stay in range of 18-21 db while doing light work such as youtube , discord, etc. Fans weren't even kicking in completely when on battery mode and temps were hovering around 50-58.Performance mode gets noisy but keeps in the range of 39-45 db and when temps hit 85+ the fans go upto 50-53db , turbo mode as expected is even louder but you can also set manual profile to control the fans if it bothers you.Screen - absolutely amazing screen 240hz with sufficient brightness, I'm using it around 40% brightness inside the room anything above hurts my eyes. So brightness looks sufficient for me.

Did lots of research and found out that we must compromise on something in 70K range. This is a value for money deal I believe. Found out there are some issues in competition like screen bleeding, so thought to stay away from other brands in this price range.You get Ryzen 4600h 5th gen (don't ne fooled by previous gen offers from others), 8gb RAM, SATA+SSD hard drives, backlit keyboard and important of all 144Hz screen. Initially my thoughts were what is the use of 144Hz screen but boy, it does make difference! Everything from browsing, gaming, typing and all windows animations look butter smooth. Very happy that I went for 144Hz screen! it's a bang for the buck and if you think it's a useless feature I beg to differ. I quiet like the design as well, before buying I was skeptical but in fact it works. Screen has a floating feel to it, and it is a tad bit taller than other laptops because of thicker chin. This makes the screen taller and it is in fact much better. You don’t have to slouch lower to stare at the screen. I would say the design elements are very ergonomic for day to day use. Additionally, with the processor, RAM and GPU combo highly unlikely that you will face a problem with processing power. No complaints there! The laptop is a bit heavy and feels bulky, but I guess that is Ok since it is a gaming laptop. Heat sinks are nice as well. The fans and the design keep the laptop cool. You feel the fans working with heavy processing, though it is not too intrusive. Backlit keyboard is a boon if you want to keep working and/or playing through the night without disturbing others. I like plain white backlit keyboard as in this one, it is classy and works best rather than any other very flashy color. Power button is backlit too. There are no glossy bits and I prefer that way; it looks clean and doesn’t feel fingerprint magnets. My previous laptop was glossy, and it used to attract everything. WebCam is okayish, can’t complain or write anything positive about it. It does the job.Surprisingly, keyboard is very nice to type on, decent travel and feels sturdy without worrying too much you can exploit it for fast typing. Although the build is all round plastic, overall the build feels sturdy. Let’s see how it fairs in the long run! Overall the impressions are positive for the laptop.I would advice to go with this one since there are no compromises at this price range. You get good processor (hexa core), GPU combo with decent RAM (can be upgraded later to 16Gb), combo hard disks SSD+SATA (SATA is clocked to 7200 rpm which is fast, others are providing 5400 rpm)! Plus, you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5, competition offers Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4! Although with my old router, I thought, I wouldn’t be able to notice net speed, but internet feels snappy on this device than my wife’s last year purchased Lenovo laptop. Only downside is, it has only 2 USB ports, I solved this by buying 220 rupees USB hub 😉 Type C, card reader slots however work fine, you get an ethernet port as well which is missing from so many recent laptops. Though the prices of laptops are going up with work from home being the norm now, I recommend investing in this.

After weeks and weeks of searching for the right laptop, I came across this and saw that 64,5k was getting me what sounded like a blistering experience (even with my limited knowledge of computer hardware at the time).ProcessorThe Ryzen 5-4600H this laptop comes with is currently 1 generation behind the latest lineup sold by AMD, but nonetheless it is an absolute bang for buck. It works flawlessly- everyday applications load at an instant, and performance-heavy games (Destiny 2, Control, Rocket League, Just Cause 3) load in about 20  seconds or less. This processor also has a huge market share, and is very popular. Of course, it's also blisteringly fast. It's even said to outperform previous-gen Intel core i7s!Graphics Processing Unit / GPUThe GTX 1650 is an excellent entry-level graphics card. AAA titles run fine on medium settings, Minecraft with shaders can run at 80-120 FPS on average. It won't run all games at the best graphic settings, but considering what you get, it's phenomenal. I personally think the investment for the1650Ti isn't worth the 8k-10k additional spending. The performance improvement for the Ti is not worth the money, as far as I've seen from reviews on Amazon.StorageThe laptop comes with a hybrid-drive storage setup, where you have the faster but smaller SSD and the slower but larger HDD. In this case the setup is a 256 GB SSD with a 1 TB HDD.SSDs ensure faster (in this case extremely fast) computer boot-up times, and the hard disk, while slower in terms of storage, gives you the opportunity to store more games. So the total storage space is around 1100-1200 GB, which will get you by for years if you keep your storage usage in check.Other factorsScreen/monitor - 144 Hz refresh rate! Extremely smooth. There is a very noticeable visual difference between 60 Hz and 144 Hz. It's amazing, and it really adds to the gaming experience. Everything looks better. If you play fast-paced FPS titles, you will find that the higher refresh improves your success rates (admittedly only marginally) because the monitor will visually update more often and you'll be able to see more of what happens in front of you in-game.Sound - Good, better than what you'd expect from standard, in-built speakers. Plenty of base, reasonable clarity. The B&O audio control app comes standard, which is a nice-to-hav,e though personally I don't use it much.RAM - 8 GB is good enough for many games, though obviously for optimal performance you may like to install another 8 GB stick for a total of 16 GB. However with a browser like Chrome open, memory usage can hover between 60%and 80%.The only disadvantage here is that the maximum supported memory is 16 GB, making it unsuitable for very high-end editing, 3D modelling and other creative work. The standard for laptops is 8GB RAM nowadays, and naturally upgrading your RAM will give you an edge.AestheticsThe laptop is made of plastic, but it looks good overall regardless. The back-length of the laptop is angular, and there's a cool looking polygon motif around the speaker area in front of the keyboard. It's a nice touch. The keys are backlit with white lights. Sadly there is no RGB option, unlike the competing Acer Nitro laptops. I don't think I need to mention this but Windows 10 is a nice-looking operating system.TLDR/conclusionAll in all, if you're an emergent gamer, this is an excellent purchase and a laptop seriously worth considering. While in terms of hardware it doesn't compete with top-of-the-line gaming rigs, it has excellent value for money. Buy it either standard or on-sale, as I feel both are worth your money.",Protik,2021-07-11,It feels illegal to buy something this good for such an affordable price range,566,Positive,HP,Nvidia,cheap,2021,2021-07
46972,"HP Victus Gaming Latest AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor 16.1 inch(40.9 cm) FHD Gaming Laptop (8Gb RAM/512 Gb SSD/144 Hz/Geforce GTX 1650/Alexa/B&O/Backlit KB/Win 11/MSO/Xbox Game Pass),16-E0301Ax",66490,77233,14,4,"The laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background program keeps the CPU working at 30%-40% even when it is idle. Task manager is launched to determine which processes are taking up CPU resources. However, the processes stop immediately and you cannot even identify what processes they were. The processor load suddenly drops to 1 or 2 percent instead of 30-40%. Windows11 is having some issues. This background activity kept my laptop/CPU hot. Temperatures can reach close to 100C even with a 30% CPU load. Task manager is now running. This keeps unnecessary background processes from happening and allows my CPU to cool down when it's not being used. CoreTemp software can be used to monitor the CPU load and temperature. It is essential if your CPU has been hijacked by an unneeded process that hides in the Windows Task Manager, as in my case.Edit: I used Anvir taskmanager, a third-party software that found windows explorer kept the CPU at 33% load when it was idle. This caused the CPU to reach 100C. The issue was solved by restarting taskmanager.I was initially unsure of what was going on, so I had to re-paste CPU/GPU thermal paste and use a third-party program to regulate AMD Ryzen temperature. You can read more about this below. We also discovered that the HP factory setup for laptop back panel had a large air vent covered by a plastic sheet. If you plan to play and keep your laptop cool, make sure to throw away the plastic sheet.My laptop should stay cool, even while gaming. It lasts a long time and I don’t have to replace it as often.I used Cooler Master Master Gel Pro Thermal Paste to re-past the GPU and CPU. The thermal heat sink metal plate had two types of paste. One was grey for the CPU/GPU, and one was white for other chips. The silicon-based paste CLG-3500 is the white paste. It can be found in the Maintenance and Service Guide for this laptop at HP. The white paste was left there because it has a lower thermal conductivity and is therefore less quality than mastergel. It was a little bit too thin so I used some Mastergel paste to fill in the gaps. These chips generate less heat than CPU/GPU, and Mastergel paste doesn't conduct electricity. The CPU GPU was made by cleaning out the entire factory and applying grey thermal paste to it with iso alcohol/cloth. Finally, I reconstituted my Mastergel paste. Mastergel/thermal paste conducts heat only to metal plates. It's up to the fans/ventilation how to remove it.The HP factory setting for this laptop blocks out the main air vent on its back panel with some type of plastic/paper sheet. See attached photos. I don't understand why HP would cover a large air vent that they created for their gaming laptop with plastic sheets. The air vent is right above the heat conducting plate. By opening it up, the heat from the plate would be conductive away. This will allow the laptop to run cooler and the fan to work less. It also allows the fan to last longer. If you have plans to use a laptop cooler with built-in fans, it would be more efficient if the back panel had many holes to allow cooler air to flow in. A backpanel on an MSi bravo laptop with the same processor and graphics card that this HP victus had exposes most of its metal plates. This allows air to flow in easily through many holes. From the photos I had seen, I thought this HP model had air vents. However, I discovered it was blocked when I actually held it. This blocking sheet was removed from the backpanel. Now my airvents are open and the hot metal plate is exposed. I created a DIY laptop stand using a USB table fan, a plastic inverted box and a large hole to allow the fan to rest in. I placed the fan in the box, and then the laptop was on top of it. This allows the fan to blow air directly at the metal heat sink/air vent plate.This setup allows me to keep my laptop cool while gaming. My CPU consumed 80-90Watts, GPU 70-80 Watts, and produced maximum heat. CPU reached 101C and GPU at 90C. GOW game displayed frames per second of 40-65fps with closed settings, and was slightly slower on rare occasions. However, since I had to repast the CPU/GPU, the backpanel air vent of my laptop was open. I also placed a table fan blowing air into its metal heat sink. Overall the laptop was cool underneath and slightly warmer on the keyboard, regardless of whether it was hot or cold. Speedfan 4.52 software also monitored the CPU fan speed. Maximum speed is approximately 4800 rpm. OMEN software can increase the speed. It idles at around 2200 rpm (without external fan) and at 0 rpm (with external fan). With my current setup and an external fan, the fan speed of my cpu is between 3800-4000 rpm while gaming. The fan speed never exceeds the maximum because it is cooler than the CPU.Two softwares are available for experts who want to directly control the CPU temperature and wattage. RyzenAdj.exe is another program that can modify certain parameters on Ryzen CPUs. The Ryzen 5600H CPU's maximum TDP power is 113 Watts. It can only operate at temperatures up to 100C. Both can be found via the command line interface to Ryzenadj software. These values can be set during a session using Ryzenadj or Ryzen controller softwares. You can reduce the maximum wattage from 113 to 50 Watts, and decrease the temperature from 100C to 70C. These new settings will ensure that the Ryzen 5600h CPU is not able to use any more power or heat up above the preset value. If you don't apply the settings again, these settings will be reset every time you restart your laptop. These softwares were used to lower my laptop's temperature. I set a temperature limit at 70C for idle/not gaming settings. The CPU would not exceed this level. These softwares can be used to adjust the temperature and TDP wattage while gaming. One example of a setting was to not allow the temperature to exceed 80C and to not allow TDP to exceed 75W. The CPU heats up very quickly even under 30% load, so only one of these values is going to be preferred. These settings were very helpful. I was able to achieve 40-60 frames per second in Racing game Dirt 5 at high medium mix graphic settings. This track simulates most weather effects and graphics. The CPU temperature did not exceed 80-81C. The GPu temperature was close to 80C, but these softwares cannot control it directly. They can only change or control the CPU values. These softwares can be used to reduce the temperature of your laptop if you don't have an external fan or a laptop cooling stand.The monitor lacks color. Recommendation to install the latest AMD Radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin Software. I increased the saturation on my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software has a vibrant setting for global display/graphics. This setting can be used to display more vibrant graphics and in-game displays.The 4GB VRAM of the Laptop graphics card can cause problems with high-quality graphics in some games. Some games like dirt 5 or Forza 5 give vram low warnings. The graphics for Dirt 5 are still very good. It could do with a little more work for Forza 5. Forza 4 is great, and it has amazing graphics. This laptop is a good value for the money, but 6GB VRAM laptops sell at much higher prices. As an upgrade to this rx5500m, I recommend a 6GB VRAM graphics card over a Nvidia3050.I recommend adding 8GB RAM to your gaming and multitasking experience. To have 32GB total, I installed two 16GB rams. Everything works perfectly. It switches between programs instantly, switching from gaming to work, and it all works seamlessly. Rare games such as Modern warfare warzone war royale and God of War used more than 16GB RAM, sometimes up to 20GB. For most games, 16GB should be sufficient.Edit: I tried several games. All action-adventure and racing games are available for EA to play subscription and Xbox gaming pass. Overall, the laptop can run at 1920x1080 resolution and at 40 fps at high graphics settings. For games that were released prior to 2020, it can run at ultra graphics. The problem I noticed was that the battery was discharging slowly but steadily when gaming for long periods of time, even though the power cable was connected. It could be my laptop's power line or my home.",Ajeetsingh,2022-11-21,"A good laptop for gaming, work/anything",912,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2022,2022-11

For 65k.If you're able to exchange your old laptop for even about 10k the deal is gold.Now the Pros :1. Perfect CPU+GPU setup. Too powerful. It takes barely 3 seconds to boot running all the softwares from NVIDIA, AMD, HP right from startup.2. MS OFFICE 2019 is free. But the 5GB plan only. Pretty efficient.3. Windows can be updated smoothly right from first start up or later. Windows 10 Home Single Language comes pre-installed with a digital license. And no major bugs in Windows 11 on this device.4. Screen is absolutely big. Feels great. If you want to run softwares or processes where you need more screen size it is definately a good choice but the quality is standard. Read CONS. I personally love big things and FL STUDIO will look beautiful on this big screen, so I got this one without much hesitation.5. The look and build of this laptop is absolutely classy. Plastic used is well polished and durable. Can easily go 5-7 years without any major structural deformation unless you throw the laptop around.6. The mouse pad with 2, 3 and 4 finger gesture support is amazing. I am impressed by the trackpad. I was surprised by how it enables 24 geture combinations. And the gestures can be customized.7. The airflow on this device makes you wonder if this laptop even has fans and do they work or not. It gets hot to about 60°C but that's pretty much about it. Not crossing 70-80°C anyday as per my usage.8. Finally the design is handsome. Everything is so balanced and it does feels worth the money it demandes. I was confused between 2021 HP Pavillion Gaming and 2021 HP VICTUS and I think the design of this machine made me buy Victus.Cons :1. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP FOR GOOD VISUAL QUALITY. The screen is not worth 65 thousands. I upgraded from my 7 years old HP 15 Series notebook and the screen is basically the same. I don't care much about the refresh rate but the screen quality is below standard straight away. Specially it feels off because its big 16 inch. Doesn't feels like FHD. If you use your computer for visual works then stop straight away buy HP Pavallion Gaming 2021 or some other laptop. You can customize screen warmth and color balance from AMD Radeon Software(recommend download, it makes life good) and then you can do well with this screen.2. The Backlit Keyboard is damn too bright for night use and even for dim evenings. Even during the day times it will divert your attention away from screen. It strains your eyes in dark/dim room if you're using the laptop for long hours. HP should have given brightness adjustment for the keyboard. Maybe sometime later it may come as software or driver upgrade but this is must. You can't keep the lights off cause they are beautiful and you can't even keep them on cause they are too bright. Also the keys on the keyboard feels like plastic strips. Not much of a typing laptop.3. Battery life is somewhat on the lower side. It gives about 4 hours of battery life. Also if you keep on default windows and HP settings regarding power usage the device will fare further. Also the extremely bright keyboard lighting does take a toll on the battery. That definately needs a fix.4. The RAM management is not upto the mark cause atleast 5+GBs of RAM is mostly in use while running Chrome(which is a RAM intensive application). Maybe it is because the system is not well calibrated with Windows 11 yet but this needs some fix or some software update. No issues as such. But if there's a way to use the RAM more effectively it should be done.Final conclusion :This laptop is more kinda smart student device. Perfect for coders and people who would be working with digital workstations.If you want a classy looking beast with top performance and handsome looks and if size matters to you(screen size) pick this one. I will advise you to buy the one with better screen characteristics if you can. Otherwise this thing is too beautiful to avoid.If you're a gamer or artist and into refresh rates and visual quality then this is a big no. You've to buy the different variant with the better screen quality.Overall worth buying.",Mukul Dutt,2021-11-30,Victus is a total BEAST but...,912,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2021,2021-11

I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount).If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!)Pros:1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN.2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance )3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds.4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock.6) Lifetime MS office accessCons :1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people.2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness.

Touchpad is good, uses windows precision drivers. No creaky noises from the chassis, 4 cooling vents.Fan noise minimal even at load. Privacy shutter for camera. 4 Usb 3.2 gen 1 ports and has all the ports you need (except sd card slot). Charging brick is of 170watts, charging is super fast(have to turn on rapid charge in lenovo vantage, 80% in one hour). Speakers are decent, can be tuned via dolby software.2) Display:120Hz BOE NV156FHM-NX1.45% NTSC, 63% Srgb, 250 Nits brightness, response rate 14.9ms.Looks just like any other 45% ntsc display out there, brightness more than enough for indoor use, looks fluid due to 120hz, my amateur eyes didn't notice any ghosting. Increase saturation in amd radeon software to make it look better, try calibrating too.I can't lower refresh rate to 60Hz, no such option. Maybe have to use custom software.3) Storage and RAM-SSD: SAMSUNG MZVLB256HBHQ-000L2.Great SSD. Read speeds of 3500MBPS and write speeds of 2500MBPS. Best I've seen so far in a laptop in this range.Has a 2nd SSD slot but have to remove harddrive to access that.HDD: WDC WD10SPZX-08Z10Standard 5400rpm hard drive, speeds upto 120MBPS read/write.RAM: Kingston 3200Mhz LV32D4S2S8HD-8. Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing. For most people, it will be 3-5 hours.5) Gaming&Performance-Hardly any difference between 1650 and 1650ti, and this 1650 is as good as a 1650ti on other laptops as you can run your display directly via Nvidia graphics(option in lenovo vantage and BIOS) so you'll get an FPS boost in games.Not much of a gamer myself, bought this mainly for productivity but played hitman 3 at ultra, both cpu and gpu temps were around 66-67 and FPS around 50-80 so good results.  Valorant gave temps around 60 for both CPU and GPU and fps around 150. Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?), slightly more than the competition. Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.  Medium usage will give you 3-4 hours(full brightness, keyboard lighting on).Don't expect rtx 3000 series and 1660tis below 70k, we have to settle with 1650s and 1650tis so no point waiting for 2021 laptops if your budget is limited.",K,2021-03-05,Best 4600h laptop under 70k!,1564,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,average,2021,2021-03

 I mean. There are better laptops with better specs. Gor example Asus TUF F15 l, Lenovo Ideapad Gaming etc. But it doesnt give this sleek yet demon look. Also the build quality is unmatched. Ive been using this laptop for more than a year now. Till now I havent encountered with a single problem. There are more than 10 games in this laptop including GTA5, RDR2, AC Valhalla etc and these things run smoothly in directX 10 giving you 120fps almost but constant over 90fps. If you push it like directX 11 then it decreases to 60fps (still constant).I bought this lap for 63k so you could wait for the offers. I game almost everyday. And coming to competitive games.. I only play Valorant so. It gives me around 250fps, constant over 190fps.It was my personal opinion for not going with TUF cuz the plastic didnt seem good. And it was too ""gamey"" It stood out a bit too much. This lap does my job so seemless and well.I totally recommend it.And yeah out of all the other laps. Only this one offered 256gb SSD and 1TB HDD. the rest of em only offered 512GB SSD thats all.You could still upgrade the storage. I havent done any upgrades so far. Nor did i overclock it.It runs great on default.So yeah thats itI totally recommend it.",Shyam Sagar,2023-02-16,Its the best choice for this price.,1564,Positive,LENOVO,Nvidia,average,2023,2023-02
63670,"Lenovo Legion 5 AMD Ryzen 5 4600H 15.6"" (39.62 cm) FHD IPS Gaming Laptop (8GB/1TB HDD + 256GB SSD/4GB NVIDIA GTX 1650/120Hz Refresh/Windows 10/Backlit Keyboard/Phantom Black/2.3Kg), 82B500BHIN",74990,96000,22,4,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap. Material used near keyboard (palmrest) is damn good.🤤Display- display is decent,I feel somewhat screen could have been a bit more brighter. 120hz is great and I think the difference between it's competitors which offer 144hz screen has no difference overall. It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries. Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them. Keyboard is greaaaaaatttt, I mean greeeaat, although I use an external keyboard but whenever I use the laptop's keyboard it just feels fab and super smooth, also key travel is nice. There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it. The graphics card is directly connected to the screen of this laptop which is a great as you can visibly get more FPS and better gameplay experience while playing. Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more. Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery. Coming to charging,it has a massive 170W power block,and it can charge using its quick charge 2.0 which is ridiculously fast. You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance. The thermals in this system is the most amazing part in this laptop, बहुत ही खुला खुला माहौल है. I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this? If you get it for 65k go for it, buying this laptop for more than 70k is just waste of money & irrelevant.",Ankit,2021-08-01,Should you buy this?

So if you put the laptop in the bed or lap, the audio quality will be terrible.2) No ethernet. Even though I bought the laptop for my sister who won't be using ethernet/ lan, it feels weird for old school person like me to not have it.3) The usb c port is very close to the charger. I tried the SanDisk dual drive go (the small one) and it fit perfectly though I was a bit uncomfortable plugging and removing it. Bigger ,bulkier devices will be a no go when charger is connected. Similarly I would have liked 2x usb 3, 1x usb 2 instead of the other way around.Other than this , it's a very fine laptop.1) The display is very nice and punches way above it's price point.2) The keyboard is nice, fingerprint is fast.3) The RAM and SSD are of good quality.4) The weight distribution is even which is very important for a compact laptop. Overall build is also satisfactory.5) The battery life is good now, but we'll have to see it holds the same over time.6) The webcam was surprisingly good, didn't expect that.Overall a very good laptop for students who will use it for reading, creating presentations and consuming media.There was a monsoon offer which offered 1 year extra warranty for 99/ 2 year extra warranty for 999. I took the 2 year one to get total of 3 years. With all that, using card offers , it still came under 35k.

Because the Victus turned out to be an allrounder! Not just for gaming and entertainment purposes, but also for full-fledged professional usage!There was not a single review when I bought it, so I’ll write a detailed review for you guys!So, if you’re looking for a powerful gaming + professional machine? This is it! Bang for the price!I got it on Independence Day sale around 68k, trust me… it’s worth it! I’ll try to explain the good things and the bad! Decide for yourself!Victus 16 (i5 + RTX 3050) – “The Ultimate Gaming and Professional Machine!”Design – Stunning & Classy!The Looks are the main highlight of this laptop, the sleek and modern design is the first thing that catches your eye! It has 16.1” big display and comes in a slim chassis compared to all other gaming laptops, making it a great option for professionals who want a laptop that looks great in the office. The lovely navy blue color and matte finish gives it a classy and sophisticated look at this price range. You need not worry about the build – as it’s high-quality plastic so the build is pretty Solid & balanced but laptop is on the Heavier side! so working on a desk is advisable. Even though it has a slim design the Thermals are Excellent! This Cooling system is best among all the other laptops in this segment. The RTX 3060 variant of this laptop has a better cooling but out of budget!So does the Screen Wobble? Yes, it does but very little! is it a concern? No! It’s not a big issue as others portray, because as soon as you place it on your desk, the so-called wobble disappears, unless you intentionally shake or move the laptop around. The hinge is not promising, time will say.Overall, Nice build with classy design. Definitely Futuristic!Display – Good, Big & Smooth!Keep your expectations low as the Display on the Victus 16 is big, smooth, and definitely good enough for a gaming machine in this price range, it’s ‘just’ good! but not that great! hope you don’t expect a 2k MacBook display at this price range! But for a gaming machine it’s gorgeous! offers a great viewing experience. The colors are vibrant and the images are sharp and I must say about the smoothness of the display, wow! on 144hz Refresh rate - everything feels buttery smooth, from navigating windows with its animations to gaming – its pure bliss! Another Nice thing - I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the display I got in my unit straight out of the box; I honestly didn’t expect that, way more impressive than I thought. The blacks were pure blacks, no issues such as backlight bleeding or dead pixels. But after a week I noticed some screen flickering happening after I switched to 60hz so I rolled back to 144hz, will update you further on that.The downsides to the display are the brightness levels max. 250 nits, it’s average! At least 300 or 400 nits will ideally be a sweet spot! It’s not that great for outdoor visibility and it is advisable only for indoor use! But, it's bright enough for rooms at home or office!If you are into Graphic Designing & Color Correction and stuff, you should get a secondary monitor, you’ll probably be having one, as this display is not that accurate for professional stuff, it's definitely something to consider when looking to get this machine for specific uses.But for Pure “Gaming” – this big vibrant display + high refresh rate – this is beautiful!Performance – Perfect CPU + GPU - Overall Beast Combination!I got the RTX 3050 variant of the Victus, it’s a powerhouse, thanks to its combination of a powerful CPU - the i5 11th Gen (11400H) is a 6-core processor that is perfect for multitasking, coding, gaming, editing, rendering, and most professional tasks. It can handle heavy workloads with ease and is more capable of running demanding applications and games smoothly. It just takes 3-5 seconds to boot up (after I removed unnecessary apps and bloatware, and disabled most start-up apps). During my return period - I tested the CPU a lot and pushed it to its limits (like stress test, benchmarking & utilizing the full potential through softwares) and it was smooth as butter and the temperature never crossed 70°c - very Impressive! It’s always around 43°c probably because I live in a hill station but still, if the temperature is your concern, need not worry the thermal management is also great! Even then, there is an option - the fans can be turned to max speed in the Omen Hub, which cools down the laptop instantly (not advisable but, works well). Its 2023, I could have gone for a 12th Gen CPU but there really isn’t a big difference from the 11th Gen, also out of my budget. If you plan to get the Ryzen 5600H version of this same laptop, is also a great choice. Both i5-11400H & Ryzen-5600H perform very similar in day-to-day tasks and real-life usage. I found that Intel was being the sweet spot for almost everything!GPU – RTX 3050 (4GB VRAM and 75w TDP) – Highlight of this Device!Can handle all the latest and demanding titles till date with ease! I experienced slight heating during gaming, but the laptops cool’s itself down and does not thermal throttle, which is a good thing.It's 2023 and you're looking for good gaming device with good graphics card, you might be tempted to go for the GTX 1650 as its cheaper, but let me tell you, my people, the RTX 3050 is a far better option at a similar price, offers a lot more bang for your buck. It has better performance, more FPS - which means you'll be able to play demanding games at higher frames per second smoothly. It also has more CUDA cores, which are like the brains of the graphics card and make it faster and more efficient. It can even handle upcoming games at medium-high settings so overall the RTX 3050 is Future Proof for Indian Gamers! I agree the 4GB VRAM isn’t sufficient enough but considering the price you won’t get 6GB variant here, but it’s okay it handles current and past titles pretty smooth. I get around 80-100+ fps (overall rounded) on most games with medium-high settings and never experienced any lag so far. Also, you don’t get a MUX switch! You don't necessarily need the MUX switch to get the most out of your GPU, just hook the laptop to an external display via the HDMI port, will do the trick. Overall, The Performance is Outstanding!RAM and Storage – Fully Upgradable!!! 2 Ram Slots + 2 SSD slotsOut of the box – it comes with 8GB RAM (3200MHz DDR4) in one slot, the other slot is empty (Both Upgradable). I highly recommend you to get another 8GB stick for the empty slot, bringing the total to 16GB for better performance in games and other softwares. Although I feel on Windows 11 the RAM management is very poor, Microsoft has to optimize it or you should definitely get that extra RAM stick. The primary OS runs on a 512GB NVME SSD – it’s pretty fast, no lags. You get another slot to upgrade. Note: SSDs are not meant to be used as storage devices, advisable to keep your storage files on a separate Hardisk. You can get a faster SSD if you wish to upgrade in the future. I just love upgradability!Keyboard + Trackpad & Connectivity – FabolousThe typing experience on the full-size keyboard with a numpad was enjoyable and had a satisfying key travel. Overall, I can say it’s as good as the Macbook’s keyboard! Yes, very good! But the backlighting is too bright, also there is no option to dim it, sometimes it’s a distraction.The Trackpad is large and responsive (nice choice as no other gaming laptop’s offers this!) I really loved the smoothness and the gestures work really well! Impressive!Connectivity is also great, the Bluetooth and the Intel (Wifi 6E) card gives great reception and stable connection, no drops! (Mentioning this because, I have seen some AMD versions facing wifi issues having poor Realtek cards).Camera – Meh! Okay! That’s what you get on a Gaming machine for this Price.Below Standard 720p camera is wide but has adds lot of noise to it! Taking video calls with this feels like 5 years behind! Probably not for streamers. Camera quality is being compromised here and not up to par.On the other hand, the Audio quality is very impressive, the built-in speakers have superb sound output. Notable point is that it’s Not loud enough for movies or loud music playback but the sound quality is top notch! You can trust me I’m a Music Producer myself! just enable B&O Audio, you can adjust the EQ and customize the sound to your preference. Of course, the Sound is processed, so Music Producers, don’t get frustrated, just “disable” the audio output from B&O, it bypasses processed signals so gives you Raw output! Enjoy!!!Battery – Average!The Battery is quite underwhelming as even the big 70whr just lasts for about 4 hours (from 100 to 10 percentage) for casual browsing, video calls, excel and office work. But, if you compare with all the other gaming laptops in this segment, this one is promising and will get you extra hours of juice to finish the day! But don't expect too much as gaming laptops have less battery life overall! - for causal work it’s fine, but if you plan to game on it, Pls Don’t! (It is not recommended to game on battery power). If you still want more juice then you can lower the display’s refresh rate to 60hz and turning off the keyboard backlighting which can also help extend battery life (keyboard backlight consumes more juice than normal, this needs a fix HP!!!)But we got more plus - The laptop charges quickly as it comes with a heavy 200w adapter (which adds to the already heavy laptop! If you travel, then Your back will hurt).Extra Goodies – MS Office 2021 (student & home) comes pre-installed with lifetime license.ConclusionPros:Fantastic Design in this segmentGood Hardware and buildSolid Performance for priceDisplay in this segmentCons:Battery life is average - since it’s a gaming machine! (Other gaming laptops are much worse).Camera is below average, could have done better (720p with noise, is pretty outdated).Heavy (noticeable when you travel a lot).I would genuinely recommend this laptop which handles both gaming and professional work with ease. It is a great option for someone looking for a reliable, high-performing laptop without breaking the bank. Classy Look + Beast CPU & GPU Package + 2 RAM Slots + 2 SSD Slots + 70whr Battery + Good Built + Good Thermals + Affordable Price!I was a little sceptic about the seller Appario, but turned out to be a genuine purchase!

 The performance is buttery smooth(top notch i'd say) Valorant on this beast(laptop of course) on 144hz runs smooth AF!(literally 0 frame drops) and also i have played BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT by connecting it to PS-4 controller, man the graphics of this game on this beast is so realistic!!!!!!!  If you notice, the CUT'S at the BOTTOM of the laptop is is different from RYZEN varient, where in ryzen you get smaller cuts at the bottom end's of the laptop, where INTEL varient gets SLEEK cut's as compare to ryzen which makes the laptop look more bolder!  Nothing is perfect on this planet, as it's a gaming laptop don't expect much battery life from it, for me it will easily lasts upto 4-5HOURS on 60Hz,  But apart from battery, i can assure you that you'll get a hang-free experience very easily.And i also suggest you people to buy this laptop from offline market, where on online we can't just trust blindly on these seller's at this price range.

I also ordered a gen4 ssd by WD in order to run linux. My main purpose wasn't gaming. Bought this solely for development works.I added secondary ssd. Opening the back shell wasn't that hard. One thing to notice is that the screw of ssd is very tight. So if your try to spin it without applying down force will endup in stripped screws. So keep that in mind. I installed Fedora 36. Faced some issues with Nvidia drivers. I would suggest to follow (https://asus-linux.org/wiki/fedora-guide/) if you are planning to install Fedora.I wanted to just try some games on this machine. So I tried pubg & hotpursuit. played PUBG in medium settings. When the heat rises, we can feel a framedrop. Avg temp was 89°C while playing games. When I tried in an AC enviorment, things where smooth. So I would suggest to invest in a cooling pad if you are into gaming.Apart from that, If you have oily hands, the laptop get dirty easily. The audio quality is fine. Anyway I was using headset.

You can't set a maximum charge limit (like 80% or 90%) at which charging would automatically stop. (Asus, lenovo, acer all provide this feature in some way. Even most smartphones support it.)

He is completely wrong about the specs and the apparent value of it. Please ignore similar baseless reviews from people who haven't actually purchased the relevant products.About the negative review about the overheating from Suman. Now this is also incorrect, at least for me. The laptop does tend to peak around 90'C for a few secs when running intensive tasks, but this is in the acceptable range for the hungry i9 12th Gen processor. My laptop never had any heating issues on initial boot-up, when sitting idle, or in daily usage, it normally runs around 60-70'C. You have to fiddle around with the settings and performance modes to optimise your system, use a decent cooling pad, and lower the ambient temperature if possible.

Against what ASUS claims (8 hour runtime on a 100% charge) - while gaming the system didn't give me an 88 minute runtime on a 100% charge. The sound quality could have definitely been better, I wasn't impressed with it.

Amazon says it's ok. MSI too says it's ok. (contacted both Amazon and MSI online). According to them, warranty will not be an issue.**Only MSI provides (consumer grade) laptops with RAM expansion capability upto 64GB. Normally, its possible with workstations only.Build Quality - I will say OK. Not for very rough use. Mostly plastic. Top surface brushed aluminum is for only aesthetics, I think. Screen / keyboard flex is on the lower side.Design - Only one thing is pretty bizarre. Both front exhaust vents are covered by the screen as you open it, thus rendering their usability almost null. Side vents are also small.Screen - Loved the screen! Not sure about color accuracy though. Enough bright / dark.Keyboard - I'm enjoying it. Key layout is a bit different. Only red backlit. Backlit can be turned off. Brightness can be adjusted.  Keys are black with letters marked in red. So you will be mostly keeping backlit on.Ports - As advertised.Performance - Again everything is fine but one. Heating! If I run two virtual machines, consuming 7GB of RAM, 35% of cpu, with FAN settings AUTO and Performance settings at HIGH, average CPU temperature is around 80 degree C. You will have to turn ON Cooler Boost mode in the middle (it will run fans at max RPM). Then you will get around 65-70 on an average. Think of external cooling solutions!Everything else is awesome regarding performance. I can't comment about gaming. I use it mostly for virtualization.All in all, it is a machine with good specs, avg build quality with normal heating issues.PS: It's charger is 150W at 7.7A. It may cause issues in some PGs / Hostels (where they don't allow to use Iron / electric kettle etc).Edit1: Yesterday my laptop screen got a single vertical line of dead pixels. It was sudden. Disappointed. Will update soon.Edit2: I visited the service center. It was an outsourced vendor SysNet. Little bit of initial ""glitches"". But believe my words, they helped a lot! Screen replacement was ordered. It took three days for the screen to arrive. Brand new screen! They called and i went to the service center. It took 1 hr to replace. Then there was exhaustive testing (done by them). Then the sign-off. That particular service center did help a lot (idk about other centers). I was able to track the repair status on MSI website too (some details). All in all, really satisfied with the service.Note: Heating will not be an issue if you can simply raise the laptop a bit from the table (to support air circulation). Sometimes i use a small fan (:P) , if it is really hot weather.All in all, after an year of use, it's a laptop worth buying. Heating is normal for an i7 processor and the given GPU. Keyboard feel is good for me (some prefer hard keys, some soft). Can't comment much on touched because i use external mouse. Upgraded RAM and added HDD.

This machine based on 3 power modes, a) power efficiency, b) balanced, c) performance, uses the GPU smartly to get the framerate or GPU loads that you need.If you need full control on your side to get most performance, keep connected to power, then select performance mode in power settings, and select high performance graphics under display settings for particular application. Gives you best framerates, but warms the hardware. Either find cooling pad or right environment to keep this machine life longer.Also, to run the laptop cooler when doing low level tasks or every day computing on word processing, browsing, videos, etc., keep it on battery, so your CPU and GPU works in low power mode to save energy and longer life of hardware.

39823,HP Victus  Gaming  Latest AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor 16.1 inch(40.9 cm) FHD  Gaming  Laptop & 805 Black Original Ink Cartridge,67251,77994,13,4,"The laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background program keeps the CPU working at 30%-40% even when it is idle. Task manager is launched to determine which processes are taking up CPU resources. However, the processes stop immediately and you cannot even identify what processes they were. The processor load suddenly drops to 1 or 2 percent instead of 30-40%. Windows11 is having some issues. This background activity kept my laptop/CPU hot. Temperatures can reach close to 100C even with a 30% CPU load. Task manager is now running. This keeps unnecessary background processes from happening and allows my CPU to cool down when it's not being used. CoreTemp software can be used to monitor the CPU load and temperature. It is essential if your CPU has been hijacked by an unneeded process that hides in the Windows Task Manager, as in my case.Edit: I used Anvir taskmanager, a third-party software that found windows explorer kept the CPU at 33% load when it was idle. This caused the CPU to reach 100C. The issue was solved by restarting taskmanager.I was initially unsure of what was going on, so I had to re-paste CPU/GPU thermal paste and use a third-party program to regulate AMD Ryzen temperature. You can read more about this below. We also discovered that the HP factory setup for laptop back panel had a large air vent covered by a plastic sheet. If you plan to play and keep your laptop cool, make sure to throw away the plastic sheet.My laptop should stay cool, even while gaming. It lasts a long time and I don’t have to replace it as often.I used Cooler Master Master Gel Pro Thermal Paste to re-past the GPU and CPU. The thermal heat sink metal plate had two types of paste. One was grey for the CPU/GPU, and one was white for other chips. The silicon-based paste CLG-3500 is the white paste. It can be found in the Maintenance and Service Guide for this laptop at HP. The white paste was left there because it has a lower thermal conductivity and is therefore less quality than mastergel. It was a little bit too thin so I used some Mastergel paste to fill in the gaps. These chips generate less heat than CPU/GPU, and Mastergel paste doesn't conduct electricity. The CPU GPU was made by cleaning out the entire factory and applying grey thermal paste to it with iso alcohol/cloth. Finally, I reconstituted my Mastergel paste. Mastergel/thermal paste conducts heat only to metal plates. It's up to the fans/ventilation how to remove it.The HP factory setting for this laptop blocks out the main air vent on its back panel with some type of plastic/paper sheet. See attached photos. I don't understand why HP would cover a large air vent that they created for their gaming laptop with plastic sheets. The air vent is right above the heat conducting plate. By opening it up, the heat from the plate would be conductive away. This will allow the laptop to run cooler and the fan to work less. It also allows the fan to last longer. If you have plans to use a laptop cooler with built-in fans, it would be more efficient if the back panel had many holes to allow cooler air to flow in. A backpanel on an MSi bravo laptop with the same processor and graphics card that this HP victus had exposes most of its metal plates. This allows air to flow in easily through many holes. From the photos I had seen, I thought this HP model had air vents. However, I discovered it was blocked when I actually held it. This blocking sheet was removed from the backpanel. Now my airvents are open and the hot metal plate is exposed. I created a DIY laptop stand using a USB table fan, a plastic inverted box and a large hole to allow the fan to rest in. I placed the fan in the box, and then the laptop was on top of it. This allows the fan to blow air directly at the metal heat sink/air vent plate.This setup allows me to keep my laptop cool while gaming. My CPU consumed 80-90Watts, GPU 70-80 Watts, and produced maximum heat. CPU reached 101C and GPU at 90C. GOW game displayed frames per second of 40-65fps with closed settings, and was slightly slower on rare occasions. However, since I had to repast the CPU/GPU, the backpanel air vent of my laptop was open. I also placed a table fan blowing air into its metal heat sink. Overall the laptop was cool underneath and slightly warmer on the keyboard, regardless of whether it was hot or cold. Speedfan 4.52 software also monitored the CPU fan speed. Maximum speed is approximately 4800 rpm. OMEN software can increase the speed. It idles at around 2200 rpm (without external fan) and at 0 rpm (with external fan). With my current setup and an external fan, the fan speed of my cpu is between 3800-4000 rpm while gaming. The fan speed never exceeds the maximum because it is cooler than the CPU.Two softwares are available for experts who want to directly control the CPU temperature and wattage. RyzenAdj.exe is another program that can modify certain parameters on Ryzen CPUs. The Ryzen 5600H CPU's maximum TDP power is 113 Watts. It can only operate at temperatures up to 100C. Both can be found via the command line interface to Ryzenadj software. These values can be set during a session using Ryzenadj or Ryzen controller softwares. You can reduce the maximum wattage from 113 to 50 Watts, and decrease the temperature from 100C to 70C. These new settings will ensure that the Ryzen 5600h CPU is not able to use any more power or heat up above the preset value. If you don't apply the settings again, these settings will be reset every time you restart your laptop. These softwares were used to lower my laptop's temperature. I set a temperature limit at 70C for idle/not gaming settings. The CPU would not exceed this level. These softwares can be used to adjust the temperature and TDP wattage while gaming. One example of a setting was to not allow the temperature to exceed 80C and to not allow TDP to exceed 75W. The CPU heats up very quickly even under 30% load, so only one of these values is going to be preferred. These settings were very helpful. I was able to achieve 40-60 frames per second in Racing game Dirt 5 at high medium mix graphic settings. This track simulates most weather effects and graphics. The CPU temperature did not exceed 80-81C. The GPu temperature was close to 80C, but these softwares cannot control it directly. They can only change or control the CPU values. These softwares can be used to reduce the temperature of your laptop if you don't have an external fan or a laptop cooling stand.The monitor lacks color. Recommendation to install the latest AMD Radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin Software. I increased the saturation on my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software has a vibrant setting for global display/graphics. This setting can be used to display more vibrant graphics and in-game displays.The 4GB VRAM of the Laptop graphics card can cause problems with high-quality graphics in some games. Some games like dirt 5 or Forza 5 give vram low warnings. The graphics for Dirt 5 are still very good. It could do with a little more work for Forza 5. Forza 4 is great, and it has amazing graphics. This laptop is a good value for the money, but 6GB VRAM laptops sell at much higher prices. As an upgrade to this rx5500m, I recommend a 6GB VRAM graphics card over a Nvidia3050.I recommend adding 8GB RAM to your gaming and multitasking experience. To have 32GB total, I installed two 16GB rams. Everything works perfectly. It switches between programs instantly, switching from gaming to work, and it all works seamlessly. Rare games such as Modern warfare warzone war royale and God of War used more than 16GB RAM, sometimes up to 20GB. For most games, 16GB should be sufficient.Edit: I tried several games. All action-adventure and racing games are available for EA to play subscription and Xbox gaming pass. Overall, the laptop can run at 1920x1080 resolution and at 40 fps at high graphics settings. For games that were released prior to 2020, it can run at ultra graphics. The problem I noticed was that the battery was discharging slowly but steadily when gaming for long periods of time, even though the power cable was connected. It could be my laptop's power line or my home.",Ajeetsingh,2022-11-21,"A good laptop for gaming, work/anything",912,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2022,2022-11
64651,HP Victus  Gaming  Latest AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor 16.1 inch(40.9 cm) FHD  Gaming  Laptop & 805 Black Original Ink Cartridge,67251,77994,13,4,"Okay so let me be blatant and true regarding this laptopI ordered this on 27th November and received this on 29th. For 65k.If you're able to exchange your old laptop for even about 10k the deal is gold.Now the Pros :1. Perfect CPU+GPU setup. Too powerful. It takes barely 3 seconds to boot running all the softwares from NVIDIA, AMD, HP right from startup.2. MS OFFICE 2019 is free. But the 5GB plan only. Pretty efficient.3. Windows can be updated smoothly right from first start up or later. Windows 10 Home Single Language comes pre-installed with a digital license. And no major bugs in Windows 11 on this device.4. Screen is absolutely big. Feels great. If you want to run softwares or processes where you need more screen size it is definately a good choice but the quality is standard. Read CONS. I personally love big things and FL STUDIO will look beautiful on this big screen, so I got this one without much hesitation.5. The look and build of this laptop is absolutely classy. Plastic used is well polished and durable. Can easily go 5-7 years without any major structural deformation unless you throw the laptop around.6. The mouse pad with 2, 3 and 4 finger gesture support is amazing. I am impressed by the trackpad. I was surprised by how it enables 24 geture combinations. And the gestures can be customized.7. The airflow on this device makes you wonder if this laptop even has fans and do they work or not. It gets hot to about 60°C but that's pretty much about it. Not crossing 70-80°C anyday as per my usage.8. Finally the design is handsome. Everything is so balanced and it does feels worth the money it demandes. I was confused between 2021 HP Pavillion Gaming and 2021 HP VICTUS and I think the design of this machine made me buy Victus.Cons :1. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP FOR GOOD VISUAL QUALITY. The screen is not worth 65 thousands. I upgraded from my 7 years old HP 15 Series notebook and the screen is basically the same. I don't care much about the refresh rate but the screen quality is below standard straight away. Specially it feels off because its big 16 inch. Doesn't feels like FHD. If you use your computer for visual works then stop straight away buy HP Pavallion Gaming 2021 or some other laptop. You can customize screen warmth and color balance from AMD Radeon Software(recommend download, it makes life good) and then you can do well with this screen.2. The Backlit Keyboard is damn too bright for night use and even for dim evenings. Even during the day times it will divert your attention away from screen. It strains your eyes in dark/dim room if you're using the laptop for long hours. HP should have given brightness adjustment for the keyboard. Maybe sometime later it may come as software or driver upgrade but this is must. You can't keep the lights off cause they are beautiful and you can't even keep them on cause they are too bright. Also the keys on the keyboard feels like plastic strips. Not much of a typing laptop.3. Battery life is somewhat on the lower side. It gives about 4 hours of battery life. Also if you keep on default windows and HP settings regarding power usage the device will fare further. Also the extremely bright keyboard lighting does take a toll on the battery. That definately needs a fix.4. The RAM management is not upto the mark cause atleast 5+GBs of RAM is mostly in use while running Chrome(which is a RAM intensive application). Maybe it is because the system is not well calibrated with Windows 11 yet but this needs some fix or some software update. No issues as such. But if there's a way to use the RAM more effectively it should be done.Final conclusion :This laptop is more kinda smart student device. Perfect for coders and people who would be working with digital workstations.If you want a classy looking beast with top performance and handsome looks and if size matters to you(screen size) pick this one. I will advise you to buy the one with better screen characteristics if you can. Otherwise this thing is too beautiful to avoid.If you're a gamer or artist and into refresh rates and visual quality then this is a big no. You've to buy the different variant with the better screen quality.Overall worth buying.",Mukul Dutt,2021-11-30,Victus is a total BEAST but...,912,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2021,2021-11

The worst part about this is it's speakers. They are just pathetic. I have a six year old lenovo laptop that still has double sound than this one. But yeah, using headphones while gaming would neutralise this untill you are watching movies or web series. Also I have tried premiere pro, blender and after effects, they work fine.

And all those reviews are big trash for me now :)CPU & WIFI 6 - With 8 cores and 16 threads, I would say it's a beast considering the price band for this laptop. Its performance is comparable to that of an I7 10750H. And the processing is pretty good and sometimes while working on the web apps it gives me an impression that they are desktop apps.Temperature/Heating: With Room temperature at 25°C CPU temperature is constantly between 34°C and 37°C when the power cable is not plugged in, which is pretty decent. But, when put on charge it is very high at 59°C which is the only cause of concern.Battery - Have set the battery setting to Balanced from Dragon Center and the power mode to ""Better Battery"" and with this setting, I'm getting a very decent 5+ Hrs from a full charge of 80% charge.Display - With the power mode and battery settings my screen would look a little dull. But Display is much pleasing after adjusting the settings. But then you may have to compromise on the battery.Graphics - I do not use this for gaming at all so I do not have much to comment about the performance of this 5500M Radeon Graphic. Again I saw few reviews not in favor of this graphics card so better cross-check if you are buying this just for Gaming.Future Ready with the following Hardware Upgrades :Comes with 2 SODIMM slots that support up to 64GB DDR4 RAM @3200 MHzAdd on slot available for extending storage capability. You can add either a SATA an NVME M.2 module and extend the storage.ConsThough the display seems to be alright now, I noticed the flickering on the initial two days of use which did not happen later. Did anyone else notice something similar?Also for some reason, I see a color variance and missing clarity while watching the youtube videos.TrackPad: There are no buttons and it's a little tricky it's not like clicking but tapping it hard at the trackpad for left and right clicks. Might be by design but MSI should consider fixing this for their next builds.Keyboard Layout: Comes with a short keyboard layout with big keys. Got used to the long keyboard layout so it's a matter of time that one gets used to it. Till then be aware of what you were typing.Material: Looks like very cheap black plastic all over.Heating: Dragon center shows the presence of two fans. But I never saw the other one working.

 TL; DR: A simple laptop with high-end computing power and a mid-range graphics performance, which can run almost every game and software out there.  Go get it.I am writing this review after using it for more than 2 months. I will try to write as many points as I can think of.I generally use it to write code on multiple Visual Studios, docker, Visual Studio Code, SQL Server Management Studio, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and run several excels as well.My previous laptop was HP (i5, 16GB, 256SSD, FHD), which still works fine. I decided to buy this laptop because of the processor and 144hz screen, as my HP laptop is not so eye-friendly and has a reflecting screen with bluish colours.Cons:1. Faulty spacebar (a common issue with MSI). You need to press it at the centre to register it (will not work if pressed on the right side).2. Poor quality webcam.3. Average sound quality and not so loud.4. No memory card reader slot.5. Only 2 USB ports (2 additional Type C).Pros:1. Powerful processing power works well even on multiple applications running simultaneously including numerous browser tabs.2. Good build quality even at this price.3. Screen hinges are sturdy.4. Great screen with true colours and high refresh rate resulting in amazing display experience.5. Ready to perform out of the box, you don’t need to upgrade anything.6. Battery life is good, I don’t expect much from this configuration though.7. Very lightweight and small size, making it very handy.8. Cooling boost feature (dragon centre) can be helpful to dissipate heat quickly.I will update this review in the future if I find anything new.",Shaminder S.,2021-12-04,"A decently priced powerhouse, ready to perform out of the box.",182,Positive,MSI,AMD,average,2021,2021-12

It's not meant to be kept on lap although it's a laptop.Performance is great and games run smooth provided you need to give it good cooling.The software bugs I'm complaining about is due to Asus's pre installed software to control performance I guess.Camera quality is poor, mics are not good sounding, all due to Asus's software maybe.And the battery, oh boy, even after having 90Wh and performance put to battery saver mode at 100% in a new laptop, it turned off within 2 hours of watching movie with ear buds. It drained more than 10% while doing nothing at lowest brightness settings and battery saver mode.--- update -I did some tweaks in the armoury crate (Asus hardware control app) and experimented with different things, now the battery life has improved a little, so added a star back, but still, you have to know what you are doing and how it'll affect you. Not straight forward. But the software is still buggy and hence, no star upgrade as it is very pricey.---What is wrong with Asus???I'm so not happy with the product with such high price tag. I wish I could get a refund 😞I wish I could get a do over with that kind of money.",Akshay Rai,2022-04-29,Hot. Software bugs. Ok battery life,16,Positive,ASUS,AMD,elite,2022,2022-04

Switches off dedicated GPU, enables eco mode(windows silent mode), set screen brightness to 50% and limits watts usage to 45W.(not meant for gaming) set display to 60Hz refresh rate.Do know this will drop performance to almost 60%(45W) of full performance(but is more than sufficient for just casual browsing and daily task and even development ). Unless you want to game or use rendering or photoshop on battery which is still possible, will obviously perform 40% slower and drain more. All laptop excluding mac's will behave the same. This 60% is on par with performance on M1pro 10c-16gc. Extra is for pushing the limits of the chipset to outperform the rest.Try to set different profile for gaming /Stress activities and another profile for day to day uses. 6-7 hours for daily use is sufficient I hope. And do try gaming plugged in(that's what this machine is meant for).Fan and thermal is not the best running loud and hot(keeping chip temp cool where it really matters ). Rather have this setting that burn my chipset inside.All in all it has its drawbacks which can be slightly tweaked and make it an all rounder.PS: Price is too high but cant say no to that bezel less display which makes it look premium to carry around and is light weight(compared to other 16 inch laptops). 3060 is sufficient and enough to satisfy most users.Cheers happy gaming.",Amazon Customer,2022-09-23,Try this for long battery.,16,Positive,ASUS,AMD,elite,2022,2022-09

Although bass is a bit less.7)Nice keyboard with a separate numpad and powerful enough Back light.8)Latest wifi version 6E is packed in it.9)Office 2021 is included for lifetime.10)Comes at a nice price point.A few cons are:-1)Upgradability. You won't be able to upgrade ram over 16 Gb and no additional SSD/HDD slot provided.2)Ports. Even 2021 version has 3 USB A Ports. This one has only 2.3)Screen wobble is less as compared to 2021 version but is still present. Battery is as much as expected from a gaming laptop.(*) I have an additional complaint against HP. You can't set a maximum charge limit (like 80% or 90%) at which charging would automatically stop. (Asus, lenovo, acer all provide this feature in some way. Even most smartphones support it.) So why a 65k+ laptop can't support it. HP MUST provide that feature if customers want it.FINALLY, How good is it against Asus vivobook pro 15 OLED, as both costs somewhat around the same.->See if you are going to consume alot of movies, web series, videos etc. on your laptop. Buy Asus eyes closed as the difference in display picture quality is same as the difference between day and night.->If you want a more powerful laptop. Asus stands nowhere against HP Victus. Its a nice and power packed laptop for students(coders and casual gamers).->If your main purpose is to play latest game titles on your laptop, then buy HP Pavillion (ryzen 5 5600h, rtx 3050, better 72%ntsc display).",kunal jangid,2023-02-03,great for professionals as well as for gamers.,418,Positive,HP,AMD,average,2023,2023-02
