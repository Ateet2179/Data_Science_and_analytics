Walmart Sales Analysis

This project aims to analyze sales data of Walmart to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement. The dataset used in this project includes information on customer orders, such as order date, ship date, product category, sub-category, product name, quantity, sales, and profit, among others. The dataset contained one missing row and a sales value, which were dropped and imputed with the mean value, respectively.

The analysis started with basic descriptive statistics, such as the largest sale, the majority of customers bought three products at once, and the greatest discount offered. Then, data cleaning techniques were applied, including dropping missing values, converting data types, and creating new variables. Feature engineering techniques were also used to aggregate data by sub-categories, product names, customers, and time.

Visualizations were used to illustrate the data. A histogram was used to show the distribution of sales after normalization. A box plot was used to show the profit by category. The technology category has the highest sales.

Then, categories were created based on the quantity of orders and the sales value. The sales by category were calculated and showed that the technology category had the highest sales. The project provides valuable insights for Walmart to improve its sales performance, such as identifying the most frequent buyers, analyzing the profitability of each product, and detecting which category generates more sales.

Finally, predictive analysis was done using Random forest regresser wich resulted in  score of 0.85
